 XXVII
After rummage'n thru a hostel
For leftover food

The workers trim'n the trees
Proselytized their community
As place to stay & eat

We traveled to their land
On the wealthy side of Virginia

This cult held
 ‘ All Things In Common

It was weird all over
Felt just like
My mormon childhood
.
.
.
An old Lady & I haggled
In a tucked away shop
On an off-season
Stretch of beach

She wouldn't let the piece go
But at a steep price

Nevertheless
The season was mine
‘ I will pay $80
‘ Get more cash
‘ And pay more in the morning

Context communicated
I don't have the cash
Take comfort in a false gamble
To save face

A split second betrayed her concession
As the woman was about to respond

Christina decided to chip in
 ‘ I promise we will come back
‘ You can totally trust us

I had to lecture Christina
That during the logistics of hustle'n
Shut The Fk Up
Now the lady has cause to curse

That Jamaican JuJu
Haunts me to this day

But I cannot part
With the Ironwood Artifact
.
.
.
Poverty is some shit
You don't know it
Unless you know it


Glue-stained nostrils of the fathers
Dirt floors & crude appliances
Of needful things

Children abused & forsaken
Where hopelessness is indeed
.
.
.
This work is only ever read
Under the force
Of my personal stare

I must reaffirm
That great works

By definition
Should never be grasped
Freely by whomever

Few should ever really relate

But that is the catch isn't it?
To find the few
The masses must echo

Life is a bitch
But one has to carry on
As one must
.

A pack of cigs
On streets

Will turn a local
Into a 2min friend

Advice imparted
With the high quality of gratitude
.
.
.
I am the spirit of Freedom
To roam & Let roam

Zanity unmatched
Wild untame

A stranger I come
As if always there

A stranger I leave
As if never there
_

You found my note
& Went to where I was
At McDs

Not hard to find
Where I am
In a small town

Yellow & Blue 1000RR
Honda craft’d with love

I see the loss
As you yearn speechlessly:

Why after all this time
Have you come to me
Age’d as I am

Why not when I was
Young & Undecided

Than now unable to adventure
.

Canadian Jasper Mtns

Camp’d at a rundown
Horse stable

My machine singular
Ride’n aside
The last Glacial strips

Designed for
Speed & Carve'n

To react with nimbleness
In all things

A gas attendant
Proclaimed my bike
' Most beautiful of all
.
.
.
The sun
The last element in life
To fail

Gaze'n at its orbit
Restricted to a 30% spectrum

Dumbstruct
& In Denial

In Yellowknife the sun behaves in odd ways

Nothing in life
Can be known in surety
.
