 L
Born in a Santified State
To die in a godless nation

I’d known like me
The nation
Never go godless
_

Life manipulated
To learn me uncertainty

This god of change
His face a mirror of activity

Change has kept me fulfilled
Change I worship

Death
The ultimate change

Death a mirror
A mockery of life

Our last memory
As one caught in solitude

Cower'n in that Beast's Den

I have cried
I have beg’d

I have worried of others
I have worried of me

Experienced now
Upon such visits

I choose contemplative grace

Heaven or Hell
My history will carry me
.
.
.
The past passes

Entropy
A creep’n nothingness

Like lose'n a dream
Upon wake’n

The power of records
The power to remember

What discarded then
Of great value today

Much I have in
Ingratitude forgotten
_

Only after my Mission
Did I earn empathy

Two years towards
Supplication for two gems

A precious endowment
To care
To care for another

The gift of sight
Bestowed upon

One once blind
Who could only see as far
As his own nose
.
.
.
‘ Spud you jerk
A troll since before trolls

At our college Halo fests
I always strove
To boil blood

16 Spartans
On two levels of house

I dove all-in often
Not always die’n

But always cause’n a ruckus
.
