 LVXXV
Up the Uintas
Thru deer trail

Travelers on
The same path

We meet
Them with friends

I move them along
Talk'n with them
_

Over & above
After the winter spring

Lay a lofty plane
Mossy green cushion

Laid out evenly 
A slope of the valleys

Best view
_

I know what
Others look like

Upon my site
Wish'n I were'nt there

My threaten'n presence
Rude 

The town of deer
Or a town of people

They both give
The  same expression
_

I continued till
Elune bore down

Up the crest
Of the hills of the summit

I abandoned deer trail
 & Blazed my way
 _

Blunt'd & Completely lost
I saw a light

I followed it
I went to where it was

What is close
In the mtns

May be near
Impossible to reach

A deep gorge
Between it & I

Was there a path across

Trees & balds
Likely places for traffic

Ancient paths
Which the snow betrayed

Overgrown & unused
Up & Down

Sometimes 
Back around

Crux of where
The gorgesides meet

A rocky cliff
That looked like
The summer's waterfall

I managed to cross
That high & severely sloped

Mostly wet
For 100 yards

The cliff had a way
To climb up

Finally arrived
Only the other side

The way up looked dry
Tho it was soaked slick

If I slip'd once
I'd unavoidably

Keep on
For as long I had life in me

Curiously
I found another path

Blindly forward
Stay'n low under the cliff
_

To turn back
I always a good option
 more dangerous
