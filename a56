August 31

If thru 76 in Penn.
You headed

Drive’n past me 
As everyone did

Cept for the cop that 
Kicked me off

How to Hitch

Calculations are relative
Only experience can teach

Drivers need time
To see you & decide

Then have time 
To find the place to pull over

That is the basis 
For all good locations

Think of it like fish’n
Nothing is guaranteed

My youngest sister
Christina

One meant for
Robust Adventure

Brought up
On the wake of my legendary growth

Arrive’n to join me
On this adventure

If the world was shatter
Who of all 
Would I save if only one

Christina is always the answer

Strong tower
Interestingly quirky
Executes on command
Complains necessarily

Amerith her dog
Equal in character & strength

I brought them both up
On the edges of civilization

Christina fly’n into 
Philadelphia
The next day

Far from there
No path yet open’d

A vehicle finally pulled over
As I walk’d slumped from 6hrs

Awestruck I see
Trail Angel Patricia

Patricia’s Plan

After dinner she hustle’d
A trucker into 
Take’n me to Harrisburg
Where Christina would now
Take the train
