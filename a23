Prepare’n for the military
He pushed forward in train’n

Travel’n this path
With a full-size guitar

A considerable feat
On such treacherous paths

Concerned about
His grandpa’s soul

I tried to comfort him
With a few passages from the Bible

That gave record
God would be merciful

Day hikers mean food

When I see 
Their luxurious camp spread
& I peruse for anything 
Left discarded by others

They usually offer me 
A bit to eat

6 Nature’s Way

I thank’d them for my
Preemptive Birthday Present

Jacobs Ladder
Never wanted to end

The elevation 
Warp’d with greed
Sticky as molasses
It’s soil grip’d you 
To toil

Up & Up
Right or Left

In reluctance only
The route issued 
A downward path

Fontana Dam

Kind to hikers
I spend most of my time 
Alone

I cherish those times
Celebrate’n the goods of Civilization

Again Roadwarrior was dumbstruck
Johnathan gave me his pizza
To add insult to injury
_

I could only spend part of the day there

Most of it consumed by kindess

A noob motorcyclist
Lost all his things
Take’n down the 
Dragon’s Trail

I found his Ipad in the grass
Next to the road

Fate’s offer’n
To bless me with a 
Birthday present

I cashed the gift in
For good karma

The Fontana Dam Staff
Tracked the noob down

Hopefully to continue 
On his journey unthwarted

Others in the
Great Smoky Mountains
Were mad at me

I cheerily ate
Pizza I pulled out of my pack

Fill’n the air with 
Cheesey Italian Aroma

Which I smartly preserved 
For this birthday dinner

Deep in the
Great Smoky Mountains

A range
Notorious for its
Aggressive Black Bears
