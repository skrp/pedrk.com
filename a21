At Cold Springs Shelter
I rummaged as I always did
Look'n for food

In the firepit I found
4 Cliffbars & 6 Nature bars

Customarily 
I shared my score
With my comrades
_

I have not met any
As frugal as myself
That could continue

Tho with my hustle’n
I could always score
Enough to share with others

On Wayah
Basalts noted 
Dead Horse Beard

Climbed with the 
Stubbornness of a Beard
That continues to grow 
On a Horse
Dispite it being Dead

Hence he was christened

I nearly stepped on 
The first
Rattlesnake I encountered

I killed the beast 
With one shot

Its soul-less body
Continued on

My next shot missed
As it crawled
Thru the thicket

To stop dead
Under a branch

I hit it with another shot
Just to be sure

Thus I was christened
3Shot The Rattlesnake Eater

By Trail & Error
I learned to prepare meat

My story follow'd 
Ahead of me

As only stories can
For more than 1000mi

All night it rained
7am Came up
With this 20yr old
Come’n over the crest

Dickie shorts
Cotton tee
Chuck Taylors
No light

Silently 
He continued thru
