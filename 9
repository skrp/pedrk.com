 IX
One memory I hold special
Of all the 2400 hours uptime

Online in the
World of Warcraft
At the Timeless Isle

We put our self to the work
Of cleanse'n those
Of the faction

Twix bears the symbol
Of our blood-fued
The Horde

Fifteen cyber knights
Of The Horde

Gathered atop
To stop our crusade of kill'n

Us
Three amigos

Charged head upon them
On that hilltop

After much brave fight’n
& Death to The Horde

We charged on thru to
Get The Fuck Out

Khlamidia
The guardian-angel Night Elf

Fearwolf
The Worgan warrior

BarnabyJones
The Warlock

We all got out
Of that fight alive

Cept for Fearwolf
Respect to that fallen homie
.
.
.
When surrounded you hear
‘ Put your hands
‘ Behind your head
‘ We got 17 counts on you

You can then
Understand the life
& What it is like
To be Me
.
.
.
My favorite times
To do wheelies
Are when Christina
Is weigh'n down the back

Once next to a family
The light hit green
The eyes of the family
Plastered onto the minivan windows

As they saw us leap
Upon the back tire

Take’n off
Turn'n left

Thru the intersection
On one wheel
The whole way
.
.
.
Aun in Mexico City
Thousand miles
From the jungle

People knew
From the deep lashes
Upon my arms & legs
I’d been lost in the jungle
.
.
.
Christina advised
‘ Don’t hit too hard

‘ I smoke Chronic
I shout’d cautiousless

Think’n this only a
Pseudo-marijuana

But Ryan & Christina
Had snuck in
Salvia-Times-Sixty

Black
Point of Light
Point of Dimension
Point of Area
Point of Corporal
Point of Position
Point of Global
Point of Relations
_

Down the rabbit hole
I fell thru reality
Until I came back up
Out the other side

Remembrance since reboot

I’d say
Life is much
Like a unix computer
.

Faith

Not something taught
Not something given

Found only
After long darkened toil

Faith
Not to Flip Flop

Faith
To trust a way
Around the impassible river

Faith
To cross 100mi wilderness
Sick & Crawl’n

Faith
The march forward
Dispite all external proofs
To the contrary

Faith
Isn’t a knowledge
Of things not seen
That is nonsensical dogma

Faith
Is an All-In

Faith
Know’n the future should fail
Tho continue’n anyway

Faith
Understand’n
This the only way
