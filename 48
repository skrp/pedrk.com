 XXXXVIII
I make
Critical mistakes

The sun set’n
30min & No taxi to take us 

The off-season in
Jamaica is harsh

I could not explain
Why all my efforts
To reach the
Government yards of
Trenchtown
Met with rejection

In a season when all
Reduce’d to beg’n

Trap’d on an island
Troubles are shared by all
_

Finally arrive’n
To Trenchtown by taxi
The driver pointed
Where Bob Marley lived
Then took off

I misunderstood the song
Thinking the Yards
Some city square where he would perform
_

Caves of poverty
Concrete square rooms

Bare walls on 5 sides
Continue’n in rows

Bob Marely proved
Destiny can pull from
The deepest pits
_

Immediately I knew
Our serious predicament

Now understand’n 
Why other taxi did not take us

Since the start Christina
Would not listen to reason

White girl
In the shortest shorts

I looked around for any advantage
Know’n I must focus

On how to survive
In Trenchtown past 8:30pm
.
.
.
4:20am Monday
Lit Up

The panorama

4 Monitors
Black & Green ASCII
Scroll’n in a flush

7ft Steel Server
Fans whir’n

Six speakers
Bump’n out

Large candle
Flicker’n

Finn attached to the 42U
Stained by thousands of Miles of mountain
.

.
False Compliments
I hate most of all

Preschool
Proudly show’n art

A Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtle

The adult gave
High praises

Such that I became alerted
Skeptically

Look’n anew at the paper
I saw only

A Circle
& Squiggly lines

Putrid is the taste
When forced to swallow
Undeserved compliments
.
