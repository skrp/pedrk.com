When the world is wrong
She tells me why

If the path ahead
Serves better as a bed
Her breath births new resolve

Often creativity
A lunatic's lie
The haze of her presence
Become the clouds
From which I fly

Frequently my words hack
Distastefully at the page
Her warm kiss lets me know
She loves me anyway

Responsibility may keep us
Apart for sometime
But not forever
She knows this with
Silent understanding

She is secure our reunion
Will be passionate
Joyous always
Our brief moments

Hand in hand
Under open sky

The grass be forever green

In the jungle you can
Give yourself time
Carry’n food

But you cannot move
Without a machete

My compass spun erratically
I grasped the GPS

Know’n if lost
Would do in the done

Normally
There is up
There is down
There is over
There is under

In the jungle
There is mostly only thru

Thru a medium of plants
By machete

Plant life so thick
I would be suspended 2ft
With 2 packs
Weighing a total of 60lbs

There is no
Watch’n for snakes

Only plunge’n body first
Into an expanse of sharp ferns
Tunnel’n thru webs of vines
Wade’n swamps waist high
That suck downwards
Towards the darkness of the mud

Navigate’n lands
Of invasive creeks
That made landmark'n impossible

There is no sanity

Turn’n right
The GPS shows
A leftward course

Travel’n straight
Towards a short fixed-distance ahead
The GPS revealed
The path a tight circle

For a short time I tasted
What it was
To be the most bad-ass person
I ever met

But now
Several weeks later
I have only one taste linger’n
The tang of defeat
.
