 XXXIX
Since my days strapped
By The Man
To my desk as a teen

Since my days sworn
To The Man
To selflessness as a preacher

My mind ever roam'd toward
The Full Pack
& One-Way Path

I gather'd my courage
To dream no more

Bought my Pack
Bought my Bag
Bought my Beanie
Bought my Sweater

 Bought the airfare
A ten day trip to
The Mexican Rivera

Land'n there
With no plan
Or idea of where-to-next
Like I always plan’d

The guy aside brush'd me off
On that long distance
Bus to the beach
I shrugged it off

Later he passed me
His cell phone
‘ Soy sordo

Sergio invited me on a boat
To Cozumel

Where I met his
Deaf wife & deaf child
& Deaf friends

That night have'n no hotel
Took the overnight bus
To Chetumal

Where I met a Japanese girl
Lay'n down next to
The biggest black pack
I ever seen

Akane invited me to
Backpacker Island
On The Belize Reef

There among
The Islandic Indigenous
There engrossed
A place where life
Is readily forgotten

Days Later Burnt
I bought a joint
From my Rastafarian Host
Deep in the Belize Jungle

The crisp of my skin
Demanded it as medicine

But I decided it was time
To end the long hiatus
Since high school

Mary then was only
An old fling

Married now years later
I have never been as happy

No longer a Dreamer
Adventure'n in Season
.
.
.
Prepared for the Martyr
As all
Lengendary Personalities

Govt disallows Centralization

The Underground
Cares only for Share’n
_

A monk to the cause

That save’n is
A Saviors Call

Skrp the NOAH
BSD|ZFS the Ark
.
.
.
The perfect hustle
Accomplished by a wiley
Black guy in Belize City

I cannot decline
Certain requests

Somehow drag’n me
To the cornerstore

Hold’n that bread
Hold’n that Spam

Proof what his family needed
_

He had definitely bought booze
Ealier for what
He should have spent
On groceries

Tho if despite
Such addiction & need

A man can manage
To care
To care for others

He is as much of a man
As any I met
.
