The hustler
That called me out

For leave'n change
Discarded on the seat

Still had audacity
To command me

' Siegeme
' Te llevo

The bus drivers directions
Clear in mind

I could not resist
The sure way of a promise

 Hustler to be hustled
A disgrace

Master of the hustle
I'll put my metal
Against this local

Heft'n my pack
Out of the van bus
As I exited

He stop'd me

' Calmense relajete
' Camine suave

Cheap shot
For the second time

Sharp guy
_

Make'n his morn rounds
Rio Pierdas Downtown

Exchange'n news
With backscene workers

We continued on

~ If you met me
~ In the States
~ You wouldn't even give me
~ The respect of consideration

The translation took me
Until it was too late
To respond
_

Sidewalk on a school corner
Sat an old fat man

Obviously the leader
Of the local schemes

The long line
Of time-pressed buyers
Waited

As the old man
& The hustler made meet'n

Hustler passed
The nights score

The old man
Pass'n only two rolls
_

We kept walk'n
Thru the city

Take'n oportunity
' Que son

He placed in my hand
One of the blunts 
Cautiously

' Cuanto?

' Dos dollares
The hustler responded

Twice the amount
Of the local price

An obvious rob
I the true master

I handed him
2 Loose dollars

Ready to pay ten
For the
Fresh Caribbean Roll
_

Twenty minutes
To arrive

The driver's direction
In vision from where he left us

But this transportation terminal
A valuable hub

The hustler
Think'n he outwit me
To tag'n along to where
He also wanted to go

So to lesson
I left him as soon
As he broke away
To greet another

To summit onto the bus
Him completely ditched

I pressured the driver
To break my $10

I let the hustler marinate a while
To be open to
The lesson he was about to learn

' Ven
I called him over

We slapped hands goodbye
Pass'n that way
A folded $5

To prove to him
By universal fashions

Of gratitude
With a day's wage

We two
Of the same stock

His interpretation
Of our situation entirely inverse
 
We parted
Him dazed by the final jab

In the decisive Oneshot
Of a master
