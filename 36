 XXXV
Wish'n never expect'n
To find a girl

Who could love me
More than I love myself

You wait patient for me
As I roam

Hot ninja ramen at the ready
Ears enthusiastic

With that love & pride-in-me
That only animals
Near pure as dogs can feel
_

In the way Maya
Smells after Amerith on return

 Recount'n the long journey
 In sniffs

By that scent off his mane
Scents stuck & potent

 Mayhap pick’n up something
That was unexpected

Yet find'n it very delightful

My weapons
Are of the Elite Grade

Ruger 357 Magnum Revolver
The wideness of the barrel

Matched by the girth
Of the steel

Acquired as a reminder
To never encounter a Mountain Lion
Unarmed again

Out this night
3am Deep in the bramble

The sound of approach'n
Is unmistakable

Once heard
It betrays fully its intention

There the fear is full
_

Fortune placed us securely
In an opening of the thicket

A small boulder & brush
At the center
10ft of open space at all sides

Surrounded by
Twists & Distortions
Vegetation warped by
 Stony soil

Magnum drawn
I tough talked the Lion

There are some notes
That are inter-species

You play your tune to its beat
& All will understand

To communicate
To this cocky beast

Tho this be his grounds
Tho he perceive
No foreseeable threat

I had something
Past his imaginations
That would blow
His brain out his skull

Vocal courage to break’n
To this cat’s cowardice
_

20 mins passed in stalemate
The next move
Would be the beasts

It’s presence
No longer heard but felt

Positioned behind the boulder
Face'n the direction
The beast had been descend’n

I focused forward
In dominate stance

My place sure
Until the beast's presence
Surely heard to the bramble
At my back

The 3am moon
Is not always bright
It wasn't bright tonight

It had successfully
Made the lengthy distance
Creep’n in circle around me

Without noise
Until that moment
Thru some preplaced path

My note & my tune
Unflustered by the sudden shift

My position I knew
Breached only partially

Upon my stolid reaction
To the change of events
Echo'd by communication

With the surprise of slyness
A cat's pride
Indisputably thwarted
Returned a growl of frustration

I can only swear
What I believe I heard

Fear truly infects sanity

All I know for certain is
Amerith would refuse to go
Into those brambles depths again

Defcon 23

Like birthday-party magicians
Script-kiddie's displayed
Tricks of cheap illusion

DefCon had a wall
The Wall of Sheep

To display any people present
Who got hacked
During the Con

In the room of
DefCon's internal network

I entered & hid

Distressed guards & management
Look'd for me

Till they stood inches from me
But they did not find me

Among the proof of
Government Collusion

I found papers
To plaster on their Press Wall
