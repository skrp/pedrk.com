I approached a girl
On the streets of Cancun

Her at a park
7am with a cat

The cat perched
On her backpack
As she walk’d

She was part of
La Banda

A transient gang in Mexico
That perform & sell
To fund their travels

The day spent
Run'n the streets
Ship'n her clothes
Home to Mexico City

We tested our character
Find’n a kindred need
To dodge cars & roam freely

Everyone gave
Their own peculiar look

First they thought
This girl looks like trouble

The shaved side of her head
Tattooed with leopard prints

Her arm bore
The tattoo of the
Closed Power Fist
Annotated with
' Libres

Shortest Shorts & Boots
A big ass black backpack
Where the Mijares perched

Next they would think
What business
Would this gringo have
With this street girl?

Looked like
I was try’n to buy
& She was sell'n

People on the street
Would yell things to us
That I couldn't follow
She would laugh amused

That was my first day
Back in Mexico

I left in search
Of the Lacandonian Jungle
At 4:20 pm

She gave me an adios
With a kiss on the cheek

When you live life raw
It rewards you
With people you need
When you need them
.

People listen
To the stories of my life

An adventurer
A pirate

That is how I design
The labor of my devotion

I am primal
The nomadic breadth
In me searches

Towards the open roam
To the free forage

Done in its
Own time & pace

The wilderness offers us
The answer to live harmoniously

Accept the reality of Anarchy

Fight for food
Fight for life
Fight for freedom

My motorcycle is a
Pinnacle of engineering

My server is industrial-grade

My skills grow fast
My body is fit

My unix systems
Exchange information

Anonymous & Insubstantial
As a haunt’n spirit

That Anarchy be preserved
 In this systematic epoch

Where I go I am respected
People listen
To the stories of my life
.
