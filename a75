The 100mi Wilderness
Warns of the implications
Of such distance

Sick since so long
Have’n yesterday
To crawl several times

I decided to risk
The 100mi

I’d fail big
Out on such a stretch
All alone

But I had no choice

Pepto Besmol
Saved my Thru Hike

Cure’n my curse 
Of unrelent’n diarrhea

Soon I recovered 
Back to full strength

Faith rewarded
V

V
Trail maintainers place logs
Allow’n passage on bogs

Riddle’d everywhere 
On Maine mtn tops

Rain kept temp 
Above freeze’n point

Confidently I step’d on a log
Comically continue’n with the log

To the bottom
Waist high in water
V
