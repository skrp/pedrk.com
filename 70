Over the ridge
of the Uintas

Boy & his dog
At 19

Day bushwack'n
Foothill to ridge

At the end of day
A choice

Take the known path
Back in the boring fashion

Or go down the backside
Thru an immaculate valley

To come out around 
The otherside of the mountain
_

In more of a tumble
Than a run

We made our way
Summer at its glory

All rested from the heat
Of the busy day

Desert barren foothills
To Snow thick ridges

To the summit of scapes
& Now at the end

Thru the magic of
Valley portals

Beams of wane'n sun
With open arms welcomed

I made my way merrily
A definite conquerer of the mountains
_

Bleed'n from the thickets
Unquestionably defeated

After twenty minutes
After open valley ended

Conquerer of mountain
Bitch of bushes

I nearly cried
( I did cry)

In total breakdown
Have'n to bushwack

Straight back up the mountain
& Then back down the otherside

Thru small thickets
Dog shake'n all the way

He didn't move
The next 2 days

I didn't ever forget 
That lesson

Never did
Learn it tho
