At a creek with a flush
In a rush

A massive tree
Span’d past the 
25ft crossing

Trunk settle’d high above
Unforgive’n boulders below

Slime layer’d the tree
At midpoint I slip’d

Regain’d myself easily
My pack part of me

Take’n a breather
Elated from execute’n
The most difficult cross’n
On the trail

I notice’d 
I missed the obvious
Cross’n aside the creek

Mountain Profile Maps
Allow you to visualize

The Ups & Downs
To come

Many times 
Many plans ruined

See’n the profiles of future paths
Victimized by underestimation

The pitch of a trail
Is only a small part
Of what makes
Traverse’n hard
 
Only 20mi in
The path already
Extremely difficult

Map tattered

The last 60mi
Illegible

Thru storms
Over bogs

Thankful the winter
Had laid low the bugs

Happy to be healthy
