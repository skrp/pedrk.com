The Overmountain Shelter
A Red Barn
 
Alone on a mountainside
Overlook’n a misty 
Valley of forest

Mice scurried thru the night
With no care of concern
Where they stepped

I fear little in life

I fear even 
Only a little water

Whether to my ankles
Or too far to see

Tentacles
Slimey-Scaled
Anonymous-biters

What monster could consider
Such dank ecosystems its feed’n ground
_

Alone at Laurel Falls
Hot & Tired

I waded towards the falls
Then there see’n
A small snake in the water

Decided only a small douse
Would be necessary

Ghost
 
I learned was an alcoholic

He only walked nights
Because then he could be 
Smashed in peace

A rare honor
To learn from 
Drunken Masters

Pond Flats
This 1700ft climb

Commonly considered
The most pointless 
Part of the trail

It was only later I learned
You could walk 15min around
_

Sometimes it’s best 
To stick to the path

For reasons
That pay off later

Other times it is only ignorance that
Keeps you on the
Straight & Narrow
