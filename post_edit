A place
Only in fantasy

Buenos Aires
Valentines Day

The people stroll'n
Lovers in hand

Romance unmatched
_

A spirit lost
To the modern world

Yet in this
Remote land
Held treasured
.

If the govt is mad at me
Well I accept the consequences
Of live'n a lawless life

It is a part of me
I wish never taken away

Tho I may at times take liberty
In the freedom of my wishes

Friends & Love
Can be lost long
But will always return
To those who seek

Of all I meet
Not till I returned home
Did I find

Kindred
Sprinkled by Destiny

To waypoints
Of how one should be
_

Many songs writ
& Stories told
Of my deeds

Elijah my closest cousin
His deeds
Only told in first person

Which are equal
In comparison
To my own

How is it
That in my long seek
I find you again

Alone as when
I was a child
Now alone
As an adult
Back home
_

I always disrespected my dad
He would say he was the shit
But he only ever rolled with family

I thought that
The lamest fault of all
Teen in my social height
_

Now with fewer friends
But still friends

Elijah was the only one
I still cared to see

We talked
As I haven't for unknown years
About the same topics
I'd shame my dad for do'n
_

Old age
I know now

Is learn'n
Your dad was right all along
& You played the fool
.

Cuban cigar
Sized blunt

31st Birthday
Hot boxed
With JJ & Elijah

I choked out first
Break'n to chicken
As I rolled down my window

The smoke
A giant cloud
Deompress'n

Over the houses
& To the sky
_

Codine coated blunts
Put me to shame
Tap'n out

Back to back blunts
Put me to shame
Tap'n out

Back to the streets
For my birthday
& I got played the pussy
.

Wife & I
At different
Strengths & Weakness

Under pressure but
Took me off the mountain

In admiration I said
' I would have
' Flip'd the fk out
' Fk you, fk this, fk everything

She replied
' I work better
' Under pressure

Her research paper due
That night

' Send over what you have
' & I'll help you
I told her in grattitude

I opened her email
It only contained
The teacher's prompt
.

Die Hard 4

If you gonna be 1337
Be loud mouthed

& One day
Some Bruce Willis muthrfkr

Bust in to say
' Let's save the universe

& I'd know
I prepared all my life

Batman knows
Robins
Know their place

A ride to die
Kind of muthrfkr

This wave
Till its end

In hopeful Washout
.
.
.
All I need
One look
One memory

Then they know
Muthrfkr cast
Apart from the rest

Your reaction
A tired route
Tho to you
Unique it seem

Off the wall
Blackest of sheep

Lucifer to gods

Try to understand
I'll laugh at your tumble

White razed black
Latin grown Mexican

American at the core
Not that fat phone type

Southern raised
& Never tolerant
When some muthrkfkn
Northerner think they shit

Fk this federation
Rember the cause

Rebel against
Two Faced Tyrants

Minorities proclaimed free
Tho cuffed they ever be
.
.
.
Cultivated
Perpedicular to society

Adventure unfamiliar
In a net

Words outshined
By the glare

Hackers
Clicked away
_

Against the grain
Black sheep

Often I suspect
This my only motive

Or that it be
Excellence when unguided

Many paths
Numerous choices

Where whim meets wisdom
Subconcious instincts unearthed

Alone
Cleanroom

The reaction pure
Wastes of reaction

In that earthly circle
Action feeds another

Off what is
Left unused

To be always as able
But never squandered
.
.
.
Time precious
Statis maddening

Give me the
Liberty of meaning

To cause movement
On the roll of life

Restrict me
In a space of no progress

Mutex Locked
Waiting that seems forever
.
.
.
Losers
Rejected by all

Those
My people

Us taken each
As an other

Know'n the
Other is
Okay with what

Not fake'n
It along
With the rest

This is
My legend
No delays

You serve the story
Or we go our seperate ways

Not selfish
Understand'n
Earthly ways

Forced
Execrements shit
Only flies like

Not the man
Of my city

That time passed

Ranger
Off the grid

In forgien lands
Full of fear

First time
O'r The Atlantic

Never heard
Of the city before
Vienna

Austria
Think'n they spoke Austrian
The entire time

Slovenia
Made me realize
I knew nothing of Europe
When I seen
It existed on a map

Ljublejaba
What kind a
Odd place is that

When you travel
On the whim

The city desolate
All the words
In that odd austrain language

I aint blind
I know whats up

Shit I always been
Scared of what
I regardless do

Put'n myself
Ever in position

To have to live
With hard choices

You might be cold
Shit'n no paper
In the same
Consistency as their coffee
+

My simple theory
' If I can see it
' I can get there

I told that man
Us alone near
Secluded military lands

His look of
Unsettled incredibility

Due to my
Assured certainty

Tho the storms
Centered on the mountains

Never permited me
To actually test
That theory
.
.
.
Fk humility
I legit

Savor our moment
Cause you will
Always remember it

A unicorn
Mixed with a stray
Mangy mutt

Magesty only in the smile
Glad for each new day

Some people are
Too stupid
To see such things

These I have to
Explain myself
Which puts me
In awkward positions
Which I'm entirely
Accustomed too
.
.
.
Every summit
I find
Lonliness unmasked

Were one thought
Pinnacles of debat

Forgotten grounds
Inmutable boulders

Trees all
Alpine runt

As if you betrayed yourself
Beguiled to a far away desolation

This the true motive
Under it all

Major players
In the unix community

Recognize me
As the loon half-baked
I embody

Deep & cold paths
Snow in proof
Of no other
.

3rd attempt
To make ridge

Met with quick failure

You only ever
Need to suceed once

This time
Blunted Blazed & Ridgeside

They asked
Of my yoga

We performed
Sacrament

Beef Jerky
No water
Is never fun

Then the chug
Moutain Dew
In one hit

Sunrise pose
Inhale blunt
Rise exhale smoke

Blaine the choo choo train
Let smoke out
Only in small percentages
Inhale'n precentages of fresh
Hypervent out

Among blaze
We commited ritual

Solitary Ridgeside
Elune enshrouded
Late no light

All were blessed
With the cough
.
.
.
Breathless moment
When a song
Is understood

Mayhap bypassed
Plenty before

Freddie Gibbs
'Just Tryin' Ta Make it

Birthed in me resolve
That succeed to Sneznik
A journey
That took many days

Against them locals
Aun to sneer
But I suceeded

Sneer me
I just smirk back

You
As the countless past

No where to find
To dance all up on
Mistaken faithless fks
.
.
.
America
Bought only a traitor

To whistleblow
On its surveillent state

Not the confession
Of community neighbors
Busy in its subversive tasks

What a day
What a day

When only a Snowden
Cured our ignorant state

A much better hacker am I
& I not a Russian Spy

If the call rise
May it be for my name
Next time
.
.
.
Life is something
That comes & goes

At the end
I hope as
Pheonix I fly

All flame 
In sudden glory

Then to darkness
Of the night
_

'Fuck the world
I'd first seen this sentence

On my wife's chinese shirt
Fate's message

My catch phrase now
'Fuck the world

'Fk the world
'How did I mess
'It all up again
Often sentiment
That goes with
My excited smirk
Mania & Lust

Out there
In the world alone

That is what
I am best at

Let youth
Give me the momentum

To fly

Didn't belong anywhere
Bury me best right here

Event at the apex
Life horizons death

Faith
Where I die sacred

It is death
That tells

A man's Tale
.
.
.
Like my Mission
Like my Appalachian Trail

Never once believed
I'd make the end

Now with all false faith
Stripped from me

Failure
The sound of Nothing

After my words
Are distributed abundantly

I just keep write'n
As I kept preach'n & hike'n

Cause the means
Is my favorite part
.
.
.
Skills
Matter most in life

Relationships end
Drugs can't create

Money flows
Best fresh like water

Things
All the things I need
I dont really like

Hammock, tent, pack, laptop
Sleeping bag, jacket
_

Been so cold
Thought I was die'n

& Those times
Are greatly overshadowed

What fate
Keeps me upon
Wings of luck

To this day
I knew I hit black

But my peanut skull
Uncracked

I remember my head hit'n
Asphalt at 70mi+

Motorcyle continue'n on
40 Yards

To smash into
A complete total
Against concrete wall

Due to
Wet damn leaves
whowouldacaredstoppedtothoughtthatwouldhappen

Friendship
Is not investment

It is
Momentary cohesion

America
Police State

Life under powerful sects
Rule hardhandedly

Administrative Thugs
Unioned Federally

I believed
I would leave

But American is what I am
American to whatever end
.
.
.
Wrote a book
Published a bit

But most I can ever do
Is leave it on a trail

To the side
Underneath what looks to be
A few days drift
.
.
.
Merit means most
To most

I merit much
But now isn't the time

To sidetrack myself
On the petty run for payment

All I need
Is what I can make
A story out of

Now it is an
Archive Mainframe

It has been
Motorcycles 1, 2, 3, -> 4
Osprey pack
1lb Down sack
Work Tie
Scripture Set
Converse Shoes
Trek'n poles

Just give me whatever
I'll figure something out

Appalachian Epic of 3SHOT
MKRX Systems

A hacker weekend
Can change a
Monumental Project

Into a well & done
Right off the back

Plenty of
Coffee

Plenty of
Bud

Guided as if by
Poltergeist hands

Something passing through
As with one last chance
To make amends
That they channel
Through you

I have given
All I had to give
To everything in life

Of this
I am at true peace
.
.

Went back home
To Corpus Christi

At my old
Neighborhood grocer
Down the street

It looked like a
Crack Town

People stare'n
Why is he here

It is fascinating
How some things
Never change
.
.
.
It was years
After the incident

Camilla told me
'Yea you did
'You flew over the car

'Oh yea
After the distant memory
Of me fly'n over the car
Fifteen - Twenty feet away
Dazed & Confused
Find'n my way back

All I cared at that moment
Was that Camilla was okay

& That thank god
I decided prudence
Against go'n wild
Down the street
From that light

No Man is an Island

Doubtless John Donne
More alone than 
I could ever concieve

Surrounded by love
& acceptance by
All those around me

Bought by my childhood
Spent in seculsion

Solitude is all 
I ever seeked
Me vs them

It is hard
To accept

Unique
An kinldy adjective countless
Used to describe me

Not till my Mission
Did I understand utter lonliness

Blocked from communication
With only a jackass
Companion for company

Not in Mexico to baptize
On Crusades of Faith

To find who 
Call to fate for faith

Mayhap bypassed
In the ardour of work

Only ever walk'n
Belt too hot to touch

Whiteshirt & tie & kakis

I am just an 
Odd type of person

But I don't see
Much life in any other way
But completely devoted

I read much
Focused on much

Before the mission
I studied this book
Along with the 
Life of Christ

The 10 Commandments
Ten ways a society
Must live in order to survive

Past times after
Empires crumble lost

Tho themselves
Once their slaves

One commandment
Alone for worship

'Dont take
'The name of thy lord in vain

Which I became to understand
The religious backdoor
For control over society

As the Old Testament testifies
There is generally 
A good reason for it

You should not take
Another nations woman

Because soil
Determines the offspring

But which was unheeded
& Led to one of many downfalls

But the ancient way of life
To live as one simply devoted

It is worth meaning
To perserve past hardships

To awaken today
& Revolutionize your life

Worst is starve to death
One is assured to live at peace in

Literally shit out
Of all your luck

Who trusts the uknown
To pay up on credit owed

I got enough loans
To know that never
Works out as planned

So best have a good time
& Help others along the way

Hard choices
To redefine a life

I promised
Would have beautiful ends

John Appleseed
Knows he will never harvest

Know'n fate will take care
Of a few of the countless

To bring 
Appease love shade stability
For generations to come

All worth
If only for two

Tho to what end I can not know
The false hope of a sour granny
Or the sweetness of washington dry

Sow'n is all
I ever really want
To ever do

No worries of justifications
When that a physical impossiblity

Faith not abide'n
The laws of physics

Miracles no science 
Can be sure to define

So I left
A year & nothing

As if so busy
I never stopped to question

In the end 
Accept'n gratefully 
The void of nothingness
A vaccum that gorges all
To fill itself
With all manner of interesting

Faith I bore
Know'n the truth had left
But would one day
Come back around

Faith I have 
On my own found

In a life
Among bretheren

Whether
Physical or intellectual

Leave'n to posterity
Too great to be
Measured in generations

This book on a life
In a manner I hoped
Myself have'n had to recieve

I am 
adventurer hacker poet

& I don't care
Which one of you
Muthrfkrs know it

No man is an island
Did you follow me?

See your way thru
All the bull shit
& Hold the pearl
That is my wisdom

Or like all I met

In horror
Like disgust'n guts
Let it slap to the ground

Better covered gutterside
Under preferred sight of trash

& Thank god
You are all assholes like me
But much less deserve sight of it
Than to consume it greedily

Peaceful & pleasant
I walk faceless

No longer
About file lust

A greater need presents itself
Independence of Humanity

Our anonymous right

But I look 
To the poor beasts
We eat or slave

A fate
I chose myself

But not one
I'm will'n to
In debt to posterity

Still I affirm
This fate I deserve

The mechanics of its motion
Longsince set

Trump Election
The thunderbolt sent by god
The universe or whatever

To crack open the earth
To be filled by our dead

Rattlesnakes
Expect & accept death

Death is the meat
Of its substance

Nobly
It finds death itself

& Sure as shit sticks
Better decapitate

Cause even four hours after death
It may get chance to strike death
Turn'n victor to victim
.
.
.
Preparation
Not only hoard'n

Hone the keeness
Of wiley skill

Live it up 
While it lasts

Long life
Isn't most important

Only to be
How I be

Till its
The end of me

Remembered in thousands
Over thousands of miles

I know how to have
A very good time

Those who partake
Of its angelic levity

Are drawn to a wild
World of rambunctious action

Warrant'n a return
Only in fond memories

Afterlife only
Offers reunion

To me memories
Best left as statues & monuments

Last days of 
October

The old man looked at me
On the fork to the interstate
Still at a distance
He conceeded
_

Vegas
Days to find
A suitable bush

Of which to mayhap
Find a few hours sleep

Perfect
It would house one
Comfy cosy & secure
Against a concrete ledge

Too perfect
About to settle down
Old man walks up
Still at a distance
& I walk away
.
.

One shot
Of me ever necessary

Pure
As alcohol burns

Hits 
Fierce as Salvia

The one time
We meet
Like a needed 
But extremely uncomfortable experience

The seed plants
& May bear zaney fruit
To any garden
Whose heart harbors my memory
.
.

Faith
A Fervor
Like Fire
Wanes at times

A blaze
Too costly
Aun for forests

Accept
A simple red core

With faith
In the coal
Of ones substance

Bounties of time
Will sing its glories
In latter days

I avoid drama
Caz I get real fkn dramatic

All parinoia & imagination
Flustered as a lil chick

Squak squak squak

Unless its
Hatred terrror ball-bust'n
It has no interest to me

If lost on valley floor
Smooth planes of ease
Stir alien horror

Mountain Pass
Path found

After Doubt & Dispear

Tycoons 
Of energy

Become my surf
All else shit'n
Themselves in panic

Or panic
To the outcome
Of a Last Stand
In lifes roulette

To be expended
Forward in rocket
Toward new spheres

She was a fool
To think one as I
Considered storms
In all but levity

Or Up
Mt. Washington

Ranger barracade'n
All in blizzard

Myself enamored
To sneak around

Just like in 
Scooby Doo

All in white
My presence unknown

Miles from anything
Alpine heights
Kept unabashed gales

Each burst
Afraid it lift me

Dunk'd to the pits
Devoid of all
But the push forward
_

Or Down
Selva Lacandona

Out fox'n the
Robed tribesman

By pay'n a local drunk
For use of his name

To the outskirts
Of their huts

Where I darted
On a log
Over a ravine
Miles into the Jungle

Trapped
Like a bug in a web

Hang'n full suspension
Every joint
Held by a thorny vine

Confident as a master
In my compass skills

Naught till I was 
Well into the jungle

Discovered
My compass didn't work

So that plan
Swept to the wind

Openly speak to strangers

Of what they 
Want to be remembered

This Syrian
Evicted from his home

War torn
By my nation's interests

Thru Turkey 
By pack
Over wilderness

Whom Austrians
Took humanely
As refugees

I held him
With great respect

Inevitably
He took me
As an asshole

People always conclude 
I get raped
Like a slub on saint pattys

What a inaccurate reason
Of how the world works

The world
Is mostly
Afraid of me

Dogs bow in admiration
Secluded ways submit
Machines serve

In the end
If it all
Only be
For the sole
Purpose of me

Life would then
Make clean sense

Cheeks burn
Freeze'n rain

Swept away
Hot tears

Too old to cry
But ball'n 

Rebelious
Regardless of the hurricane

Look'n in

Where my friends lived
North Bayside hoods

Only with option
To return home

The very reason
For the dramatics

Consequences now

Grasp'n air

Gamble paid off

Hot streaks must be played
Out to more glorious ends

Summer Adriactic morn
On Italian coasts

Night in Alpes
Thru blizzard

Late night 
Innsburick

A major city not
The small mountainside city
In plan

Plans 
psh I get by everytime

That arrogant haste
Forget'n each lesson learned

Umbrella wrecked
From Sneznik

Wild ground
A distance from city center

I swung damp & cold
When water just broke snow

The mists
Soaked regardless of tarp

Welcome I greeted
The next snowy morn

Vienna 
Courtgrounds

Enchant'n 
Places to write

The birds
Each with stories
All their own

They play out
Their day-to-day game

Admiration of foriegners
At ever turn

Those of statue
Cast in with a deed
Entropy hard erases

Can my written word
Last longer

Value seen
In time-old tales

Adventures
Regardless of time nor region

Much more admirable
Than those dainty-smug-fks

Relentless
I work in life

I'll get at the marrow
Of the bone of my desires

Times it takes days
Others weeks to months

Of it all

When answer meets question
When rest meets peace

& Thank god
My beast mode
Is matched by 
My stoopidity 

Well the answers
Unsheaths the truth

It always simple
& Stare'n back

Undeniable proof
Of what it is

The Afterlife
Why I do all

I dont pretend
To know what that means

But I do know
If I can remember
I can be me

Me without memory
Outlies my definition of being

Entropy 
The hand of 
La Santa Muerte

Memory is errosive
But writ
In a readable way
Reforms it

RAM Files ZFS
In parallel 
How myself exists

Mean'n can be
Mostly stripped

If the data
Is stripped of metadata

To a 128K-block
In a sea

Chemical properties
Ready to be contsructed

An idea
Born into

My self vessel
To its play

SICC
Storage In Complete Chaos

Data
With no metadata

Named
After its sum

Pools
By LibMagic

System a puzzel
That only humans
Can solve

skrp 
Issuer of a new era

Logic on how
To beat the machine

Captcha trap of
Binary Intelligence

To store data 
Openly & Obfuscated
.

.
Lost
To the point
Of cross'n into
The wrong state

Motorcycles
Correct mistakes quickly

Not plan'n
That the plan

A loose leaf
On change'n winds

Powwow to befriend
A temporary assicate

Water
From tap or spring

Food
Packed on back

Bed
Deep in woods
Of in some
Clever position

Sleep
Under shelter
Or not at all

Nothing garanteed
Granted actions at home

Here 
only longlost memories

But so difficult
The position

One forgets 
& Feel'n is lost

Cold hardened
Sun tested

Seasons
So long ends lost

In the inifinite
Of the moment
*
*
*
I roll in life
Like the 
Big Bang
At my back

Got places to be
Got plans to do

This than that
To get to
Calculated positions

With Writers Voice
Well worn

Body
In a plumb pristine

Hope'n not firmented
Distilled clear as water

With that bite
Worse than anyother

Take me young
Take me faithful

Let the eplosion
Of my end

Propel my bang
Loud to centuries

HiTech Ideas
Odd american talk
Class adventure tales

Mary at my side
Pack at my back

Inform'n
On what I wished informed

Master of my own
Among subjuated masses
.
.
.
The path I follow
A glide

Remnicenst of my
Most reoccur'n theme on dreams

Float'n on airs
Sensitive to its currents

Bound in this reality
That is an impossibility

But the lessons
They taught me
Maybe keep me 
On current today
.
.
.
Live each day
In understand'n

Of what makes
Now special

Relations
Job
Aspirations

Worn by trials
Journeys unappeal'n

Past ignorance
On the ridge of intellegence

Peaks & Gorges
Passes & Foothills

But never back
Down the valley

Where peaks past horions
Where any panorama days journey

Upon elevations
Peaks come & go
Freely & whenever

Connect'n disparate ranges
.
.
.
Faith past coincidences
Sifted now as obvious product

Portland 
Peaceful on a Island

Boston
Busy & disant

Tired
Home down the story

Airport Bus empty
I was arrive'n 8hrs early

'Superstorm Sandy
'Hit'n in a few hours

The airport is closed
Because of a storm?

In Texas 
We have hurricanes

'We can get you out of here
'On a plane leaving in thirty mins

Thats the fortune
Of the faithful
.
.
.
All we have
Are silent dreams
_

'I wish
'My president
'Was my best-friend

'Fresh Carribean Rolls
'President Trump
'& A suite

'Of any person
'Ever in existence
'I'd take Trump

'Free to get wreq'd
'As we want

Those words the gateway
To its reality

As if the universe
Played passive
To hearts desire

Putin roll'n
Coked up with thugs

He didn't greet me
It wouldn't be proper

But he gave me a 
Swift look

That was as 
Solid & Invite'n
As handshake

Of the 2 tables
All out
But the 3 of us

50 Million dollars
& Both my kidneys
On the table

Hooked up & handled
By a Nobel Laureete

'All In
I called

Eyes on Putin
'Maybe I make you Russian
He laughed pleasantly
'Call

Trump who was only in
Because he put me to lose
For a few
Lost of interest easily responed
'Call

King of Clubs 
3 of Spades

The pair won me at 
Johnnys

Now
Made me a millionare

The Laureete 
Replaced my organs with such grace
I could hardly tell
They were ever out

Somke'n Cubans
Just jet'd in

The Laurette busy work'n 
But us three casually talk'n

Trump & Putin
Neverend'n 
About their adventures

Save'n the world
From ninjas to androids
To when they had to breach dimensions

Third-wheel those hours
My highlight

Before the end
I'd instigate 
The action
Of the end of the world

Into a night
That even they 
Would never forget

No pics or vids
Never forget'n
Trump crowned 
With a gold MAGA cap

On the grounds
OF the National Monument

At peak flight
Of Putin's 
Russia Special Dip

Myself have'n used a tie
To makshift a thong

Nudity for a reason
No one could remember

Run'n from hummers
Escaped into the 
White House

For a reason
None of us remembered

Have'n to get
Soaked in the thorny bush
Cold & naked
But do'n my best not to show it
In presence of King Putin

Thru a window 
President Trump left open
For this exact purpose

We hoisted ourselves
Leave'n blood streaks
That already got 
Distant dogs howl'n

Pass'n out
On the Presidetial Rug

Have'n to lay on
Last weeks hooker's towel

Wake'n up mid-air
Freak'n out
Tethered to a helicopter

Get'n pulled up
By Russian Special Forces

Grab'd inside by
Princess Ivanka 

On critical mission
To protect the life
Of our Princess

From the BLM squad
Sent by Barak Obamamma

Bullets flew
Spotlights ever accurate

I caught the blaze
As if on premonition

It at the corner of my eye
A laser weapon from space

As if pulled
I took Princess Invanka 
In my arms

Unhindered by the
Hopeless Russians

We lept
In a hurdle'n mass
Princess in arms

The flash of a beam
Gone but linger'n as a ghost

Erupted the helicopter
In blue explosions

Duck pond
Against air pressure
But the only option

There allowed the
The Princess unharmed
From land'n thru me

Saved by her
All muddy & fierce
As she unstuck
Me deeply embedded
In the muddy muck

Bruised
But nothing broken

Princess Ivanka
Carried me to 
A 10 hut village
Which became apparent
Was North Korea

In the local dialect
She asked for
Gum cigarette coca-cola
Cooper-wire & rubber gloves

She ladder'd to the powerlines
Took apart her ear'n
& Hack'd herself 
Into the direct line
Of His Majesty Kim Jong

A limo
Rated nuclear-bunker

Soon picked up the Princess

Inside the mod Cardinal
An immensity of a man
Put put his hand 
As I made way to enter

The man's hand
The size of my chest

I was too muddy
& The interior was sacred

'Go to Bangladesh
'To the Royal Sweet

A business card
Hidden by his massive fingers
Fluttered lightly down 
As he drop'd it 
For me to catch

The Princess cried
At the brisk part'n

A last micro second sight
Of beauty in memory

Precious past probabilty
Liable for fruad

After the sounds
Of the large engine
Lost in mountain passes

Dazed at the last 
24hrs Exactly
When I bumped into 
President Trump

North Korean Mountains
Starve'n in only a tie-thong

& A Malaysian Passport
Name'n my 17yr-old mugshot
King Reginald His Magesty XIV

Excellent in health
Relative to my history

In Mexico
The women of the church
Would feed us our 2pm meal

An excommunicated witch
Was allowed to feed us

Grateful I never
Questioned her lifestyle

She would serve us
Extremely dark gravy 
Heavily spiced meals
Of mystery meat
My companions took
As chicken hungrily

Her golden serpent ring
Openly revealed herself

As she would lay down
That Sunday meal
_

Witchcraft
Lost to the North

Since child in tune with the streets
In their homes visit'n as church-people

None was even heard of
What is a staple of Mexico

Sects of this
Solitary religion

Dark Masters
In veiled niches

A plain putrid malice
They set up as shrine 
To their odd ways

Self-sacrificed to 
The Lord of Vengence
[[
Whom many erroneously
Voice as La Santa Muerte

A god who wishes
People die as they live

At least that is
My feel'n
]]
Craftsmen in Concoctions
Vile past beastly

Kept in jar
Buried or hidden

Or only some
Spetictude

At the home
Of the victim

Parts of bodies
Of vengeful dead

Sent enroute
To regain the flesh stolen

Enraged at the desecration
Are the belief of this craft

Or a small vial
Enough to stink
An entire nieghborhood block

Parts of almost every marketplace
Contained dealings for such
.

Hacker
In an anti-hacker state

Crocker the first hacker I knew
Lived alone at the 'park
Found 1337 thru insomnia
Book by book he read

The FBI expelled
Him from all universities

After Novell told the government
Who was told by the schools admin

Who was told by Croker himself
Report'n a hole that opened
Free access to the network

A typical story
In hacker circles

Omniscient power
Is power over ignorants
_

My country whines
Why are Russian hackers better?

As it maliciously treats
Wizards as witches

Inject'n my traffic
With packets

As they conspire 
To manufacture 
Probable warrants
_

So what is a 
Muthrfkr to do

That is too Texan
To leave america

Just try to be good enough
To get outta any situation

Russians may have 
Well fed hackers

But true is beauty 
Where naught else blooms

Overrun by
Lizardly look'n tech-dorks
That excel in press'n buttons

A massive organ array
Are my assorted input & output

3 Keybords +
Good luck GUI bitch

You are an asshole
& Have used 3.7T over
300G cap

Whole house enraged
When comcast broadcasted
That message to our broswers

'Comcast tried for months
'To find the contact
'Then they realized
'We were get'n it for free

Guilty as charged
.
.
.
Local dives
Places for dark deeds

In the lot of
Implied ends

So if there is some
Muthrfkr out of place
In casual countenance

Don't assume its bluff
Don't waylay your path
To converse there

I don't get drunk
In other countries

But regardless of country
I'll call out 
A local out his dive
.
.
.
Whiskey is a dark harsh draft
Meant to level with hard times

Beer a deep bubble'n
That uplifts bitter days

It a turmoil that begins in the gut
Released into an exhilarate'n burp

Exhale'n all settled concern
.
.
.
Divergent Trajectories
Momentary uncertainties

That drag consequences
To infinities

Know'n this or that
Spark towards ends
Obscured by time

Daily decisions
Dramatic in rewards
_

Saturday uncertain
But in the end decided

I'd go to local university
& Use their gym

I saw legs
At a vend'n machine
In the distance

But I remembered in a panic
My milkshake needed ice
From the cafeteria on the other side

These weight gainers
Were slightly work'n

Think'n how I'd
Finally amassed

I see the legs
In the distance
Leave'n the vend'n machine

I caught up to her
Invited her too meet me
Over at the gym

Chinese 
Know fireworks

Since that day I been 
Whole-concentrated on
How to hold-on

Form'n into an idol
Chinese Buddah
Merry & Fat

I have unshakable faith
Aun a knowledge of proofs
That science the truth

My fate 
Gonna-be great

Tho happy as happy can be
Life aint all about that

Pain is my meat
That sustains momentum

Pleasantly drawn
As a siren sings

To think of Adventure
Of something good-riddance

Ducki
My wife

The epitome of a 
Magical Companion
I only wished to have

Her actions defy
Any logical bounds

I ask something
& It magically appears

Fix'n an audio-issue 
On a recent 
cli to xwindows
Ubuntu Linux

Retrieve'n 
'A needle in a haystack

Food all my life
I hated as nucsiance

Morph'd to a blessing
That can enlight you to
Higher states of being
.
.
.
Breach'n borders
Definitions bricked by age

To dam a movement
Lakes of prayers 
Latent energy pooled

Till a small breach
Break'n forth
In violent spews

Engulf'n all
Till everything 
Is part of onething

My pack
Like scuba gear
Keep's the turmoil
A habitable place
.
.
.
I try my best
To write
In the manner 
Of me sway'n lightly
Bobb'n in brisk walk
Exhuberant of expression
Tell'n you something
You will always remeber
In a fashion that 
Is polite only second

Till past time
After all-else lost

The jackass lost
Purged out
All of it

The Mean'n
In ephipany hits
& Enlightens you
.
.
.
Past a stab
To the heart

Bow'n to tremble
If remebrance
Of an act

A scar you
Will not let heal

Consequence
Under no circumstance
Forgot

To lift your heart
No matter how dark
Today's storm

You certainly
Had it come'n
.
.
.
'Fk the world
Spontaeous Spurts

I always relied on
To ready me for a new turn

Still get them now
Tho they fall unheeded

I never had
Life like this before

If you never stole food
Then you never will know

A life
With so many Ball
.
