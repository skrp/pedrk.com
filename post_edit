El Botanico
A cat refuge

Deep wooded
Deep city park

A place
Only in fantasy
_

Buenos Aires
Valentines Day

The people stroll'n
Lovers in hand

Romance unmatched
_

A spirit lost
To the modern world

Yet in this
Remote land
Held treasured
.
.
.
If the govt is mad at me
Well I accept the consequences
Of live'n a lawless life

It is a part of me
I wish never taken away

Tho I may at times take liberty
In the freedom of my wishes
.
.
.
Europe
No cell
Nor plan

First time
O'r Atlantic

American
Rocky Mountains & Appalachians

Curious at
The Alpes
.
.
.
Friends & Love
Can be lost long
But will always return
To those who seek

Of all I meet
Not till I returned home
Did I find

Truth kindred
Sprinkled by Destiny

To waypoints
Of how one should be
_

Many songs writ
& Stories told
Of my deeds

Elijah my closest cousin
His deeds
Only told in first person

Which are equal
In comparison
To my own

How is it
That in my long seek
I find you again

Alone as when
I was a child

Now alone
As an adult
Back home
_

I always disrespected my dad
He would say he was the shit
But he only ever rolled with family

I thought that
The lamest fault of all

More krews than
Count on one hand

Night after night
In different packs
_

Now with fewer friends
But still friends

Elijah the only one
I cared to see

We talked
About the same lame topics
I'd shame my dad for
_

Old age
I now know

Is learn'n
Dad right all along
& You played the fool

Cuban cigar
Sized blunt

31st Birthday
Hot boxed

JJ & Elijah

I choked out first
Break'n to chicken
Roll'n down window

The smoke
A giant cloud
Deompress'n

Over the houses
& To the sky
_

Codine coated blunts
Put me to shame
Tap'n out

Back to back blunts
Put me to shame
Tap'n out

Back to the streets
For my birthday
& I got played a pussy
.
.
.
Wife & I
At different
Strengths & Weakness

Under pressure but
Took me off the mountain

In admiration I said
' I would have
' Flip'd the fk out
' Fk you, fk this, fk everything

She replied
' I work better
' Under pressure

Her research paper due
That night

' Send over what you have
' & I'll help you
I told her in gratitude

I opened her email
It only contained
The teacher's prompt
.

Die Hard 4

If you gonna be 1337
Be loud mouthed

& One day
Some Bruce Willis muthrfkr

Bust in to say
' Let's save the universe

& I'd know
I prepared all my life

Batman knows
Robins
Know their place

A ride to die
Kind of muthrfkr

This wave
Till its end

In hopeful washout
.
.
.
All I need
One look
One memory

Then they know
Muthrfkr cast
Apart from rest

Your reaction
A tired route

Tho to you
Unique it seem

Off the wall
Blackest of sheep

Try to understand
I'll laugh
At your tumble

White razed black
Latin grown Mexican

American at the core

Southern raised
& Never tolerant
When some muthrkfkn
Northerner think they shit

Fk this federation
Remember the cause

Rebel against
Two Faced Tyrants

Minorities proclaimed free
Tho cuffed they ever be
.
.
.
Cultivated
Perpedicular to society

Adventure unfamiliar
In a net

Words outshined
By the glare

Hackers
Clicked away
_

Against the grain
Black sheep

Often I suspect
This my only motive

Or that it be
Excellence when unguided

Many paths
Numerous choices

Where whim meets wisdom
Subconcious instincts unearthed

Alone
Cleanroom

The reaction pure
Wastes of reaction

In that earthly circle
Action feeds another

To be always as able
But never squandered
.
.
.
Time precious
Stasis madden'n

Give me the
Liberty of mean'n

To cause movement
On the roll of life

Restrict me
In a space of no progress

Mutex Locked
Halted by 3rd-party
.
.
.
Losers
Rejected by all

My people

Us taken each
As an other

Know'n the
Other is
Okay with that

No fake'n
It along
With the rest

My legend
No delays

You serve the story
Or we go
Separate ways

Not selfish
Understand'n
Earthly ways
.
.
.
Not the man
Of my city

That time passed

Ranger
Off the grid

In foreign lands
Full of fear

First time
O'r The Atlantic

Vienna
I didn't know
Of Austria

Apart that
They spoke Austrian

Slovenia
Made me realize
I knew nothing of Europe

When I seen
It existed on a map

Ljublejaba
What kind a
Odd place is that

When you travel
On the whim

The city desolate
Words all gibberish

I always been
Scared of what
I regardless do

Put'n myself
Ever in position

To have to live
With hard choices

Cold
Wet no shelter

Shit'n
No paper runs
+
My simple theory
' If I can see it
' I can get there

A man listened

Us alone near
Secluded military lands

His look of
Unsettled incredibility

Due to my
Assured certainty

Tho the storms
Centered on the mountains

Never permitted me
To truly test
That theory
.
.
.
Fk humility
When legit

Savor our moment
Cause you will
Always remember it

A unicorn
Mixed with a stray
Mangy mutt

Some people are
Too stupid
To understand

I have to
Explain myself

Which puts me
In awkward positions
Which I'm entirely
Accustomed too
.
.
.
Every summit
Loneliness unmasked

One thought over
Pinnacles of debate

Forgotten grounds
Immutable boulders

Trees all
Alpine runt

Beguiled to
A far away desolation
_

Major players
In unix communities

Recognize me
Loon & half-baked

Odd outside
The standard lines

Deep & cold
In thicket paths

Snow in proof
Of no other
.
.
.
Blunted Blazed & Ridgeside

They asked
Of my yoga

We performed
Sacrament

Around flame
Of fire

Beef Jerky
No water
Is never fun

Then the chug
Moutain Dew
In one hit

Sunrise pose
Inhale blunt
Rise exhale smoke

Blaine the choo choo train
Let smoke out
Only in percentages
Inhale'n precentages


Solitary Ridgeside
Elune enshrouded
Late no light

All were blessed
With the cough
.
.
.
Breathless moment
When a song
Is understood

Mayhap bypassed
Plenty before

Freddie Gibbs
'Just Tryin Ta Make it

Birthed resolve
To succeed to Sneznik

A journey
That took many days

Against them locals
Aun to sneer
But I succeded

Sneer me
I smirk back

You

Mistaken faithless fks
As countless past

At the end
No where to find
To ball up on
.
.
.
America
Bought only a traitor

To whistleblow
On its surveillent state

Not the confession
Of community neighbors
Busy in subversive-tasks

What a day
What a day

When only a Snowden
Cured our ignorant state

A much better hacker am I
& I not a Russian Spy

If the call rise
May it be for my name
Next time
.
