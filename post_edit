El Botanico

A cat refuge
Made out of a
Deep wooded
Deep city park

A place
Only in fantasy

Much can be derived
From this society

Buenos Aires
Valentines Day

The people stroll'n
Lovers in hand

Romance unmatched
A spirit lost
To the modern world

Yet in this
Remote land
Held treasured
.
.
.
If the govt is mad at me
Well I accept the consequences
Of live'n a lawless life

It is a part of me
I wish never taken away

Tho I may at times take liberty
In the freedom of my wishes
.
.
.
Europe
No cell
Nor plan

First time
O'r Atlantic

American
Rocky Mountains & Appalachians

Curious at
The Alpes
.
.
.
Friends & Love
Can be lost long
But will always return
To those who seek

Of all I meet
Not till I returned home
Did I find

Kindred
Sprinkled by Destiny

To waypoints
Of how one should be
_

Many songs writ
& Stories told
Of my deeds

Elijah my closest cousin
His deeds
Only told in first person

Which are equal
In comparison
To my own

How is it
That in my long seek
I find you again

Alone as when
I was a child
Now alone
As an adult
Back home
_

I always disrespected my dad
He would say he was the shit
But he only ever rolled with family

I thought that
The lamest fault of all
Teen in my social height
_

Now with fewer friends
But still friends

Elijah was the only one
I still cared to see

We talked
As I haven't for unknown years
About the same topics
I'd shame my dad for do'n
_

Old age
I know now

Is learn'n
Your dad was right all along
& You played the fool
.

Cuban cigar
Sized blunt

31st Birthday
Hot boxed
With JJ & Elijah

I choked out first
Break'n to chicken
As I rolled down my window

The smoke
A giant cloud
Deompress'n

Over the houses
& To the sky
_

Codine coated blunts
Put me to shame
Tap'n out

Back to back blunts
Put me to shame
Tap'n out

Back to the streets
For my birthday
& I got played the pussy
.
.
.
Wife & I
At different
Strengths & Weakness

Under pressure but
Took me off the mountain

In admiration I said
' I would have
' Flip'd the fk out
' Fk you, fk this, fk everything

She replied
' I work better
' Under pressure

Her research paper due
That night

' Send over what you have
' & I'll help you
I told her in grattitude

I opened her email
It only contained
The teacher's prompt
.

Die Hard 4

If you gonna be 1337
Be loud mouthed

& One day
Some Bruce Willis muthrfkr

Bust in to say
' Let's save the universe

& I'd know
I prepared all my life

Batman knows
Robins
Know their place

A ride to die
Kind of muthrfkr

This wave
Till its end

In hopeful Washout
.
.
.
All I need
One look
One memory

Then they know
Muthrfkr cast
Apart from the rest

Your reaction
A tired route
Tho to you
Unique it seem

Off the wall
Blackest of sheep

Lucifer to gods

Try to understand
I'll laugh at your tumble

White razed black
Latin grown Mexican

American at the core
Not that fat phone type

Southern raised
& Never tolerant
When some muthrkfkn
Northerner think they shit

Fk this federation
Rember the cause

Rebel against
Two Faced Tyrants

Minorities proclaimed free
Tho cuffed they ever be
.
.
.
Cultivated
Perpedicular to society

Adventure unfamiliar
In a net

Words outshined
By the glare

Hackers
Clicked away
_

Against the grain
Black sheep

Often I suspect
This my only motive

Or that it be
Excellence when unguided

Many paths
Numerous choices

Where whim meets wisdom
Subconcious instincts unearthed

Alone
Cleanroom

The reaction pure
Wastes of reaction

In that earthly circle
Action feeds another

Off what is
Left unused

To be always as able
But never squandered
.
.
.
Time precious
Statis maddening

Give me the
Liberty of meaning

To cause movement
On the roll of life

Restrict me
In a space of no progress

Mutex Locked
Waiting that seems forever
.
.
.
Losers
Rejected by all

Those
My people

Us taken each
As an other

Know'n the
Other is
Okay with what

Not fake'n
It along
With the rest

This is
My legend
No delays

You serve the story
Or we go our seperate ways

Not selfish
Understand'n
Earthly ways

Forced
Execrements shit
Only flies like
.
.
.
Not the man
Of my city

That time passed

Ranger
Off the grid

In forgien lands
Full of fear

First time
O'r The Atlantic

Never heard
Of the city before
Vienna

Austria
Think'n they spoke Austrian
The entire time

Slovenia
Made me realize
I knew nothing of Europe
When I seen
It existed on a map

Ljublejaba
What kind a
Odd place is that

When you travel
On the whim

The city desolate
All the words
In that odd austrain language

I aint blind
I know whats up

Shit I always been
Scared of what
I regardless do

Put'n myself
Ever in position

To have to live
With hard choices

You might be cold
Shit'n no paper
In the same
Consistency as their coffee
+

My simple theory
' If I can see it
' I can get there

I told that man
Us alone near
Secluded military lands

His look of
Unsettled incredibility

Due to my
Assured certainty

Tho the storms
Centered on the mountains

Never permited me
To actually test
That theory
.
