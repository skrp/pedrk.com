 XXIX
Born on the Air Force Base
In Mountain Home, Idaho

There ingrained
A deep respect

For the Nez Perce
Native American Tribe
_

The Selway Wilderness borders
A Nez Perce reservation

Remote still the edge
of that wilderness

Yet four Nez Perce
Came to where
The Salmon leap in season

Back at their home
On the Reservation

High-Schoolers Drop-Outs Parents
Party'd that school night

Wild to contest
Parties past of my Friday nights

The Step Dad woke me up
3am on the couch
‘ I don't know who you are
‘ So if you want to sleep
‘ At my house on my couch
' You have to drive to get beer

The Rite of Death
This Ritual of Awaken’n

I give as a gift
To those I love

Christina not even a teen
Would accompany me
On late walks
Upon the Urban Streets

She was to cross on her own
I-Beams that stretched
The length of this incomplete Overpass

100ft above
The ground far below

‘ If you make a mistake you will die

& I'd be quick to follow
 _

Sawyer took upon a great boulder
Which to climb

 ‘ If you make a mistake you will die

& I'd be quick to follow

On his own he leap'd back down
From reach'n the summit
Into my anxious arms
Overstretch’n my balance on a rock
.
.
.
I wildcard torrent traffic
In the upper-crust
Of the undernet

Oddities & Rareities
Fall into those gutters

Once inspect’n
What had gathered for the day

Lay a fat 52.8 GB file

Weeks of leech’n
Accumulated to acquire it whole

Internet's Best Compilation Of
How To Seduce Women
videos text & mp3

Such a thing was impossible
I proclaimed defiantly
For to leech
One must first Seed

For this monument
To not only exist
But be served consistently
Escaped any rationality

The world is wide & weird
Still Darwinian limits
Inhibit all matter
_

At a party with my cousin's cousin
I discovered
He had been a Seed
