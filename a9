In the morn I met
Orange & Juice

A gay couple that came out 
To rough it

Speakers strapped to their pack
60lbs+ each
Short Tights & Solar Panel

They asked to borrow a lighter
I gave them one

I couldn’t
Make use of it

In gratitude
They offered powwow
_

Did they know of Nessmuk
One of the saviors
Of Bushcraft

Techniques nearly lost
Of how to settle in the woods

Forced by sexual preference
To often trample in the woods

I’d not been high
For some time

I had been in Argentina

Then I had been 
Extremely depressed

For some time
For many reasons

Tho the morn before 
Assured me with confidence

It was time to have a 
Happy High

Baptized in Smoke
Affiliate'n me with

The Order of Adventurers

An Order 
I desperately craved
Since childhood

Which I sought always
Tho never found

Yearn'n the wilderness
Yearn'n the roam

Yearn'n a path 
With no return

Enjoy the present
The future is an 
Unstable promise
