Wildcat Thunderstorms
Ran out the tourists

Alone to be romanced

Autumn Colors 
In Height
In Gleam

Bright from gratitude
Of a long seasons life

Leaves
Give their best last

Fore winter
Ushers its die’n day

I will always remember
The first step into Maine

Our American Frontier

A cylinder of 
Autumn Orange

Maine in grace
Lets green youth go

Beavers are assholes

Flood’n everywhere
With their dams

All water changed
To a distinctive 
Leaf piss-color tea

Maine Mice
Acrobatic & Intelligent

Sensible in take’n
Only Ramen
After the dinner of my pot

Dry fruits & nuts 
Left as an offer’n

Stay determined 
Thru the upcome’n winter

Mohousic Notch

A canyon riddle’d
With boulders

Proof even gods
Leave projects unfinished

Puzzels Trials Riddles

With great grace
I performed dexterity

My pack
Truly have’n integrated into me

Is John your real name

We met at the parking lot
On the otherside of Moushic Notch

You told your tale
Of keep’n warm all night by fire

I called over FrieghtTrain
Who you selflessly geared

New socks & headlamp
Necessary as night took 
Most of the day

In that park’n lot
Three skated

One came over
‘ You thru hike’n?

We pass his test

The reward
A joint unmatch’d
In girth

His friends protest’d
But he understood
