I meet up with the homeless
That creep'd out Wiggles

He told me
‘ Cats taste like tuna

I gave him some food

Caught up to my friends at camp

I told them my amazing find
& Dropped down 
All the cokes

DHB was exasperated
But Bathsalts was game

DHB explained 
‘ This was Trail Angel Food
‘ We should be respectful

He didn't believe
I was ignorant of the 
Existence of Trail Angels

The idea that strangers 
Leave food out

Which other strangers 
Eat naively

Seems ludicrous for anyone with 
Preschool street smarts

I laid sodas like 
Easter Eggs

Thru the ridge
On my way out in the morn

There are few things spookier
Than the sound of water

When you are alone
In the woods

Water is best drought
From the source
Before the end of day

Before sight 
Is replaced by sounds

Before knowledge 
Is replaced with assumptions

Plops & Trickles 
Drips & Flows

Become vocalized
In overtones of sadness

Remember'n its wild past
Formely held sacred
As a shrine of life

By respectful 
Beasts of the forest

Albert Mountain
Marked 100mi

The trail still under 5%

Numbers at that point 
Become irrational

Redefined by circumstance

To disrupt normal 
Algebraic computation
Upon omnipotent planes

Prove’n by proofs
The limitless

Each day
A Derivative of the Infinite

A sine in rhythm
Orchestrated by the 
Calculus of primal Nature
