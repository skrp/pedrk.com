Wiggles
Dance'd down the mountain

She come up to my tent
On the last rays of day
& Ask'd permission 
To camp with me

Odd to want to camp 
With a stranger
In the woods
But I allowed it

Wiggles re-taught me firemake'n
With simplicity

‘ Find alot of dry crap 
‘ Light it in a loose bunch
‘ If there is no 
‘ Dry crap to be found
‘ Use your stash of Birch Bark

‘ Birch Bark can be lit wet
‘ Always carry it

She was 22
Thru hiked the year before

‘ You can always find a way
‘ To keep on go'n 

I explained
‘ I only plan to get to Maine
‘ I have no ties to the trail

She smartened me up
‘ If you can do 
‘ Katahdyn in October
‘ You can do anything

‘ Always Remember
‘ Don't ever leave 
‘ Your pack high

We gather'd wood together 
Into the night

Forest warped by fire 
Into dance'n shadows

Later I discovered 
Our meeting
Was not chance

Bathsalts & DHB
Who had eventually passed me

Met her & told her 
To stay with me

She smoked out a homeless
Because he said 
He was a hiker

Consequently 
She was freaked out
