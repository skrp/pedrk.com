 LXVI
It is said
Friends are actual enemies

Locked in competition
To out-pace the other

Secret joy witness'n 
The other's misfortune

Peers in merit
Often to courage to continue

Those that bear one farther
Down a course 
Than one would do so alone
 _

A Ranger
Able to survive in an environment
Better than its denizens

Some ideas
Too dangerous to do so alone

My ideas
Too dangerous
For the company of others
_

None with electric connection
To bind our energies

A neutral fog pass'n thru
The mass of humanity

To stranger
As stranger

I gaze at this generation
All those around me

As one friend
With many faces
.
.
.
To bark

The sound of one
Express'n themself all-out

A call to
Public competition

Obnxious to most
Tho most rarely have merit
From which to boast
.
.
.
Funky Coefficents
Exist in the
Mathematics of Reality

Certain results
In sole favor
Of the interest
Of the individual

We all embody that Concept
In our own form

In the end at death
It all don't matter too much

Afterlife?
I'm concerned
Only with the Day

If I persist to exist
Then I'll work up a ruckus

If It an obliterated nothingness
I am weary in need of sleep
.
.
.
If this hit
Helps me have a good time

Well I'll access what is available
To get me thru the day

My chi
Sublime in the form
Of a blazed vapor

There have always
Been two in my head

What a welcome
To have a third entirely Alien
.
