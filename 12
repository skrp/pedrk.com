' fk it lets go '
A slogan to which I default

Before death defy'n leaps
Off waterfalls
Into dark waters

Or into gateways
Open & Await'n

4am Salty
On the Cancun beach
Caked in seawater grime

The flight landed
Well into the night

I had nowhere to go
But here

I met a hustler
Empty of pocket

This zaney character
A pathway I could not decline

We made concession
I paid for a shower & a bowl

He revealed himself a Magician
& Gave me a potion
Which I drank in prudent sips

The Magick he practiced
Was of the vein of Pain

A scorch embedded
Deep in his flesh
Of a cigar ember held
By his Master
To imbue the brew we drank

His farwell was a forewarn
To not cast the elixir away
_

In the Jungle
Situation compelled me
To discard the elixir
upon the ground

Babe
I'm crazy as hell

How else do you think
I have so many stories to tell

Two Thousand Miles of Mtn
Alone
Of   Course
I am
Just a little bit
     Off

I care little for
Here or There

It is the same
Pretty much everywhere

All I care for is the story

rich dick richard rick skrp
ricardo Elder bitchie-ritchie 3shot

I'm a man of many names
But what you hear of me

May prove Legend

Tho I be
As batty as a second-rate hag

Perk your ear for a hear
I always have something to tell you

Tho you think me kooky
It is because with insanity

I only see thru people
Your presence is purely ethereal
.

Mania
Diagnosed

Awesome to Live
By those Slopes

Slow ups
Go’n only one direction

& Those fast downs
Rapid but irratic
_

What religious magnificence
Works a fire into blaze

Combustions
Eminate in naked forms

Birth’d
By the hands of Man

Upon the product
Of his Mother Nature

Until ashe
Each sing songs in
Celestial Styles

Freed from
Corporal form
