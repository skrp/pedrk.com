 XXXXVII
Smoke’n a cig with a
Homelss ex-carnie

I needed tolietries
He led me to the store
Where he exchanges
Bottles for beer

I been around homeless
Since I was a child

Like any wild beast
Once you get to know them

You know the places
To take liberty
_

Before the Overpass
Over a small river

A guy on a skateboard
Staggered by

Obedient to my rule no.1
I asked him a question

In reality only care’n
For conversation

‘ I’m with a group
‘ Come check it out

He led me curiously
To the local homeless shelter

Definitely not a place
To take liberty

All outside
Late at night

Managed to get
$10 worth of weed

Unfortunately that meant
Get’n change from a $20

The recipe
For night long paranoia
_

The homeless tag’d along
Want’n to go hitch’n with me

Always happy for company
Tho never off my guard

We went to the forests

I warned him
Of the cold of night

He countered
He was Canadian

I taught him
To make fire from a candle
When wood is wet

He taught me
How to keep that fire going

Until 4am
Constantly gather'n wood
.
.
.
Poverty casts dark shadows

I’ve been offered children
I’ve seen the result
Of that life in older children

Terrible scenes
Arise like fungus in
Dank & Lightlessness

Horrors Hell
Would turn its back to
.
.
.
History is evil
Good comes naturally

Evil a scheme’n
Which must be invoked

In a summons
Of formulae

Mechanizations
Atrocitices of Alchemy

Exchange’n life
For power

Like Russia
To Ukraine

America in WWII
Traded youth

For spoils stolen from
Another man’s war
