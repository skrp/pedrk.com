With Hoosh
High after dark

Wildly tumble’n down 
Prospect Rock
In a Redneck Truck

Two hits & gone
The ride of 
Willy Wonka Horror

Hoosh’s face painted & demented
Manically laugh’n
Over the rumble

‘ Holy shit look at this incline
‘ We are go’n to have to 
‘ Fkn hike back up this tomorrow

Redneck Trucks
Break Laws of Physics
With beer only

Cross’n paths with an elderly
On the Long Trail

It was the one
That thought 3Chop would steal
The gause she leant for 3Chops blisters

Hoosh doesn’t normally make fires
Because he is always in a rush

When he makes a fire
He knows his craft

Walkingman ’99 & Carlos
On the Long Trail

I set up a hustle
Invite’n Hoosh

Hoosh cooked shrooms
He pick’d to go with
The large steak

We got high & wrqd

Hanover
I loved enter’n you

Snacks in bins
Oreos for the rain

Walkn’n casually 
Down wealthy streets
