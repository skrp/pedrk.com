Mountain springs stained red

‘ We gonna be shit’n iron
I commented

Up on that ridge
A night blazed in bonfire

Alone
Look’n at that bright sky

Hope’n someone might be look’n back

Whether molecularly alien
Or government surveillant

Hope’n it gaze back at me
Think’n
 
‘ Look at that crazy 
‘ Muthrfkr
‘ Deep in the woods
‘ Blazed alone

In the morn
Post bonfire

30min look’n 
For my favorite shirt

Find’n it far away
Chewed with coon bites

Jaws left its form
In 30 places

I liked the shirt
Even more

Never wear clean dry socks

Weekend Warriors
With 60lb+ packs

Train’n to be 
Like us

You taught me 
To light fire with a candle
When it pours terribly

I taught you
The value of
Spax my axe

Return’n to camp
With a trunk
Of already dead tree
