Under Blue Moon
Riverside for some time

Pleasant paths
Patches of Sandy Bays

Arrive’n to shelter
A bit past late

Another already inside
He introduced himself 50+

We had met in the Great Smokeys
The day of my birthday

His father just passed away
He had to escape & think

The promise of Ice Cream
Is the promise of society

Race’n past
Green Thumb

The best of Connecticut

On the last 2mi
Chant’n Ice Cream

When we realized 
We could make a resupply

Us have’n to sneak into the store

Bought our ½ gallons of ice cream
From a bitchy clerk

3Chop stew’d with anger
On a bench outside

Ate the whole half gallon 
With her machete

Sundays of Salisbury
Hadn’t changed

Dotty thanks for that water
You haul up 
Mt. Everett

She said I would not make it to Katahdin
Before it closed for winter

She gave me her number 
Offer’n to drive me

To Flip Flop
If I decided on it

I only lost 3Chop once
The day we got to 
Great Barrington

My sister’s last stop

The future is too unsure
To worry what it holds

Tho I’d lose my only
Trail companion

The future is too unsure
To worry what it holds

She took the rest of the Donuts
She took the rest of the cash

Kelly a classy doll

Kind enough to give me her number

She picked me up
To smoke me out a blunt
