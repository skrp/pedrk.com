Roasted Pepperoni Medallions Over Parmesan

After 
Butterfinger PB Taquitos

The day was to write
To enjoy the present

My hurried pace 
Kept me urgent

Tho there are treasures 
Only a fool would pass
v
v
v
The trail now drenched 
With the battles of the
Civil War

The air different
Vistas never virgin

All in something
Abstract from human

As if over time
The individual cries

Mellow into a united hum 
Of like-minded confusion

Fredrick

Learn’n of the town 
I decide to hitch in

Wander’n Far & Wide
Stop’n at a drum circle

There I met an Egyptian
Tweak’n still from Rainbow

He invited me to accompany him
I’d get a ride back to the trail

He was going to see
The girl that left him 
After 3 years companionship

At the bar
The Cellar Door

It was poets night
One poet I could never forget
Tho his rants I thankfully have
v
v
v
Down dark forest roads
Thru its twisty narrow paths

The Egyptian drove
Drow'n his vision with tears

Tail end of the acid trip
Last’n weeks of hippie-fests

Car swerved to his emotions
My knuckles white 
Brace’d for over an hour

Want’n to get out
Prepared for the worst

We arrived on indian land
Burnt a fire & slept

In the morn
He took me back to the trail

Obviously ashamed 
From the episode of the night before

Strangers are the 
Best friends for these situations
v
v
v
Stray dogs 
May follow you home

After you offered powwow
Think’n such thoughts
Take me home to care for

Later sober’d up
Me on the couch

Always awkward for you
Feel’n unthreatened but unaccustomed

I am accustomed to awkward situations
