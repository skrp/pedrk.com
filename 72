 Corruption of Murray City Court
Five minutes
After the train rail lifted

A cop car stops in middle lane
On the phone look'n at me

The rails longsince 
Out of sight

After a while
The lights went on

The UTA train cop
Demanded my identification

I question his 
Jurisdiction

He cited the 
Utah State right

Utah police have the right
In every Jurisdiction in the State

I give him my ID
He then calls for backup

They demand my fingerprints
I told them I'd only sign

They arrest me
Spent Friday Night in jail
+
+
+
I filed an internal investigation
Troll'd them before the hearing

Caught the dickhead cop
In a lie against his testimony
He seen me jump over the rail

I proved that rail
Had walkway thru it

The dickhead cop
Testified that I wrestled them 
For 30 seconds

The other cop 
Said it was under 10 seconds

Then I caught 
The Judge sleep'n 
During my testimony
_

I filed an Appeal
& Another Internal Investigation

Expose'n the cops
Lies I fought them
Their own records disprove

Months later 
I saw the cop
In a pitiful circumstance

Months later
I discovered Murray Court
Used a judicial loophole

They sent the appeals court
Bogus info & I was never summoned

I gave Murray Court
A copy of my proof

The manager denied claim
To the error
' Nothing we can do

The next year
A different worker
Claimed the error
On their part

 Claimed it unprecedented
& Filed a warrant
For my arrest

I'll never present myself
To a corrupt court
.
.
.
I cherish the expression
Of the prosecutor

Dazed
By my stupidity
_

Prosecutors 
Have true power
 With them
The deals are to be made

We reasoned privately
He was a reasonably guy

For a $200
To settle this all

I told him
I'd have to think about it

When my case was near
To be heard

He asked if I accepted
I decided against offer

His jaw drop'd
He regained himself
Put me last
After everyone left

The American Dream

To stand strong
Against tyrants

No matter how
Little they be
.
.
.
I disdain
Judges most of all

I read the woes of Moses

Tortured by scwabbles
That never cease

Days full of lies
& Acts
Of self preservation

Life as referee
Of people locked
By the scum of their feud

Appointed to govern
When man releases
Their inner beast
_

You swore to this
Muthrfkr so own up

No one force you here
Keep your oath

Your daily annoyance
Has long reach'n consequences
To those you sworn
_

No names needed
When hate to them all

Wish'n the treasure
Of a four letter curse
To which curse an entire kind

That branch of Government
With the most trust
& Least oversight

The branch of Government
That corrupted the others

With the darkness
Of a betrayed lover
_

A clean glove
Will never clean
The greasy slime
Without itself
Become'n the same
.
