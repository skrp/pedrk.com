 XXXII
Nomads drift'n
From one home to another
Move'n as mass

A herd of hooligans
Out-stay'n our welcome
Wander'n to where next

As if parents in
Unsigned consortment
Paid their share
When visit came due
_

Once there was a place
That would not reject us

An abandoned warehouse
Known in the annals as
Skatehouse


Cross the street of
Miller High School

Lay the drab forgotten graveyard
Of my kin

Up & Thru
That graveyard fence
Bordered another
More recent graveyard

After those borders
You come to a grassy pathway

To where we
Cut a pathway

Thru a fence of wire
To a building
Abandoned long ago

Its concrete lot
As spacious as the oceans
Too much space to ever skate

Once some sort of
Newspaper printery
Newspapers stacked in heaps
_

Once sleep'n above in the
Overlook'n Overlord Office
All Unventilated & Grime

The night had been a wild
Party in the Graveyard

Eight of us lay there
Javi Javier Dorsey
Sal Jesus Homer
My older sister & I

Upon the 70s carpet
Caked in dust

Like sand
In a beach-side tent

Around yellow'n paper of
70s Playboy

My older sister & I
Lit them upon the candles
Spread around for light

After throw'n them
At each other

The fun spread like fire
All Toss'n & Avoid'n

We had to escape
Thru the cemeteries

As the firefighters came
Ban'n us forever
From a home span'n several months
.
