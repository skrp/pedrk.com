An elderly man picked me up 
As I walk’d

Down the pass
Thumb out

His wife & he
Drove to Alaska every year

Tho not since
She been gone

Children nor Grandchildren
Willing to accompany him

He let out 
His lonely tale

Strangers are sometimes 
The safest confidants

Often I had been that Stranger
Confident in stride

Those in moments of weakness
See this & bear their sadness upon me

Sad tales & horrific scenes
Help’n them bear burdens
That can never be forgotten

Whether subject to the 
Horrors of poverty in Mexico
Or here in the States

Everyone look'd at me 
With disbelief

I stuffed
$100 worth of $3 goods
Into my small pack
On a bench at Walmart

I had to walk nearly 2mi
Before a truck
Went into the parking lot
Enthusiastically honk’n
 Its horn

The omnipresent 
Encouragement of locals

Around where the 
Appalachian bears it course

Is
Phenomenal & Unparalleled

At the summit of
Tray Mtn

A group in kilts
Informed me

I missed a note
Bathsalts & DHB wrote

Despite my full pack
I made the 13mi
Still to go

Friendship is rare
I live a lonely life

Tomorrow 
I would reach North Carolina
Nothing could change that fact
