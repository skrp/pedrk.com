Day circled in temperature
Path circled in grade
Landscape circled in fauna

Each blissful in simplicity

Able to easily distinguish
What made each special

The call of the trail

A kingdom all my own
A land all alone

The shade of the wilderness
The respite of the springs

Mayhap the luck of a powwow
Overlay a rhythm to this path

Master of this environment
Able under any circumstance

Peaceful without a past
Peaceful with no future

Waynesboro 
Degraded by drug-use

Arrive’n as 
The Bathsalt Gang
Feature’n FreightTrain
 
After a Chinese Buffet

They headed into the hotel
I headed into the night

First to find weed
Then find somewhere to sleep

Get'n weed off the streets 
Is truly a tricky task

At Krogers Grocer
I happened upon a disheveled man

Wild hair 
Wild eyes

He said he could get me some
Drunk he dropped the 40oz

The security guard kicked us out
His friend was wait’n for him out in the car

Hella mad he came back empty-handed
Himself already ban’d

At Patrick's

His family 
Outside by the firepit

' This is a AT hiker
' He want's to buy weed

We took off in his Subaru

The benefit of the storm
Is firewood was abuntant
Of a tree’s best cuts
_

Patrick had a 4yr old
Two step children 
9 & 14

& A crazed wife

Abuse was apparent
The BBQ never touched 
By the hungry family

He never got around 
To take'n first bite

The 14 yr old girl ask'd 
What she should do with it

Patrick ordered her 
To compost it

She then asked him 
To turn the music up in the car

This was the time of night 
Patrick let loose

Loud & Detailed 
Of Sex & Suicide

Police recently called on him
Because of his attempts to kill himself

Wayne 
The friend that drove him earlier

Came over & laugh'd on 
How they trained their wives

Wayne's wife came over
Arm in a sling

Wayne took half of her pain pill

Patrick's wife Tera 
Returned as ordered

Arms full of appliance cords
Cut to burn the copper

Which when burnt 
Emit beautify arrays of color

Past 3am 
The dealer came buy

I got my 1/8 
They were preoccupied with meth

I bailed into the night
Filthy with memories

Swollen with pity 
For the children

Subjected under
Unbound dementia
