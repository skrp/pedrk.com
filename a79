Mount Katahdin

To express that day
Takes me past 
The limits of my skill

Silence to reserve 
A moment most revered

Heretofore untainted 
By inadequate narration
_

That behemoth of earth
Solitary against 
Those plains of Maine

Placed an altar to the Gods

That he who 
Seeks & Summits

Rise for that moment 
To transcendental depths

Intrigue'n the
 Weary & weather-stained

A climb above 
The monotony of hundreds past

Icicle draped cliffs & Monumental boulders
Technical Shifts & Slights

To rise up
Above & Alone
That day October 24th
_

Of my deepest desires
Sits cast the Impossible wish 
To travel to extra-terrestrial spheres

Now at the winter's summit
A feat countless plainly stated Implausible

Lay UnEarthly 
Blood-red flatlands

Hosts to grasses 
Individually crystallized in ice

Tho hundreds of thousands 
Shimmer'd in the wind

Each caught the sun
Each possessed 
For that infinitesimal moment

As host to a Supreme Radiance

Changed for that instant
Into unique choirs of light


There caught of heart
The Ordeal done
& Now the moral understood

That Impossible or Implausible
Life can never truly 
Be counted out
