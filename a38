Daleville had a shelter
For those suffer'n
From that storm

They fed me & gave me a place to rest

The next day 
Pass’n two hikers

I learn in their pack 
Listed my only friends
Bathsalts & DHB

How grateful I was
To have friends again
After those hundreds of miles

Everyone was stay'n at the
HoJo Inn

That place had all the drama of a crack town
Stuffed under one roof

Naturally 
I found myself in the middle
Of that nights scandal

Only DHB & Bathsalts
Would know if that time alone

Tipped the bucket
Did in the done

I had to go crazy
Eventually
( If not previously )

I guard Pop Tarts
With my life

My pack 
My mate

Forced to cuddle together
Night After Night
Food & All

If I lost my supplies
To some animal
My hope was done

If my quantum theory
Is true

Then many of my Me
Must have fallen
Victim to hungry murderers

Never thought
A gay could be 
More manly than me

The first of us
To drop balls
& Jump into the James

The first of us
To take that 
Narrow 25ft+ Sloped Dive
Tween Darkened Masses 
Into a hole 
6ft in diameter

A feat I accomplished
Only despite much fright

A lady drove up 
To the drunk crowd
Curse’n us as we wait’d
For our turn to leap

Some kid died just recently

‘ He died cause he was drunk
‘ And fucked up
One reprimanded the lady

I didn’t correct him that
They were also all drunk
