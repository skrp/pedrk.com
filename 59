 LIX
Dark corners

Those niches
Of expertise

World around
Too bright

With only my light
Experience The Universe
With distinct sense
.
.
.
Unbroke PF Firewalls
Finally after years

On every node of my system
Effective in less than an hour
A rework wrought
With the ease of a whim

My skills leap
In bounds & bounds

Perl
A language of love

To stimulate her kernel
With the grace of form

A natural soothe
Between me & my Beloved

Together
Never again alone

My Huckleberry Finn
Of Binary properties

On the roam
Up the rambles

A journey
Of two best friends

Adventures on dark planes
Of Neverending Stories
.
.
.
I always
Respected Ryan’s ability
To handle THC

Beads of sweat
Formed into streams
Down his forehead

An event
Without precedent

He passed the Dab
& Torch’d the bong

Sink’n into
The musty basement couch

THC like helium lifted
The soul to soar

Entraped by cords of relation
Ducki soars with me pleasantly

Duckie now call’n me
With orders to get her
_

On my motorcycle
Mostly lost

Bask’n in the relax’n
Motion of the road

A papermade boat
Float'n with the creek current

Man & Machine
Best friends forever
