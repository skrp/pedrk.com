I was once approached
By a man
He was well-built
From his lifetime
Build'n with bricks

With only a few months in Mexico
Spanish easily eluded me

What I had misinterpreted
As friendly conversation
Was revealed a dire situation

When my Mexican missionary companion
Took shelter in my shadow

‘ Voy a rompar tu cara!
The bricklayer exclaimed fiercely at me

After he had taken the time to narrate
The mistreatment he had endured in America

My order bound me
To play the sacrificial lamb
& Take the asskick’n like a man

‘ Mira tu camisa
My companion squeaked from behind me
Point’n to the enrage'd man's shirt

The man unclenched his fists
& He unclenched his jaw
Which dangled open & loosely

As he stared down stoopified
At the large American Flag
He wore on his chest
.

People think
Because we are not compatible
I have some defect of character

They say I am too cocky
& I am of pure embellishment

But I see them
In complacent lives

Compared against
My great historys of Adventure

What regard or relation
Could I associate with such beings

Precious souls as mine
Encounter few kindred spirits

Those I meet
Are mostly incompatible

Life goes on
In different ways
For different days

I cherish my life
Love yours

Mayhap you one day enact
a story to behold
.
