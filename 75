Cocky muthrkfr
I meet lotta people

Aint no one
Even hold a candle

To what I am
Known for

Thus I proclaim
Myself World Class
In what I do

Not much competition
To my sides
To be honest

For that perfect bush 
To sleep in

Out late at night
On desolate streets

On hopeful highways
Look'n for a ride out

When we talk

They here
Due to habit

Habitually pieces of shit
Addicted to some shit

Habitually
I talk a whole lotta shit

That is why
I am here

From grocery stand tax preparer
To main underling at an accounting firm
To Data Analyst into Staff Accountant
Before two years

In the subject
I studied at two schools

4th Year now
In what people
Regard as career

Much is beautiful here
But its like exercise

Its one of those things
Do it then its done
 _

Keekay Genkai
Of the 
Village Hidden
In The 1337

Now that is
Where honor is

Not in leadership
Of instruments of Blood

The mastermind
Of mechanical Nodes

Summoned from 
Formulae of code

Daemons birth & aborted
For one fork alone

Who seek death
By bug suicide

Like fire
Electrons
Cry for release

All done
In the quirkiness
Of the master
+
+
+
Mastermind
Has my path
Defined me in such regard

Logic on 
Such massive numbers

Must be stable
To the core

Or it nuke
The most stable
_

Logic & infinity
Parsed into code

Razer keyboard
The unix terminal input

Matrix characters
The unix terminal output

A mozart
In my peculiar way

Clackity Clack Clak
Moon till noon

Melodies of data in numbers
This generation once
Regarded as infinite

My code plays out
Days to weeks

I slime by
Win Big or Lose Big

Tendrils of fate
Puppet a jackass
Not graceful
But top shit
Of archive systems
.

.
My cousins
Weren't to be fucked with

That kept me
From get'n ass-kicked
First year high school

Two OG seniors
Offered to roll
Skip'n school

Slowly bump'n
Creep'n the hood

Nose'n the streets
As a large fat cat
Checks its territory

An unlikely opportunity
I took gratefully

The hood always 
Regard those
Of the community
As their own

Out there often
Visit'n as church people
 _

Pour this out
In memory of
Mentors
That made me me
