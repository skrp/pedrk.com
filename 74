 VXXVII
Sacrament

When I roll out
On open roams

In back alleys
Or forested crevices

Where shadows
Reach unheeded

In silent prayer
To place me
In harm's way

That I
Over anyone else
Play victim

The hunter
As my hunted

Make a move muthrfkr
Cause I'm always ready

To spill blood
In some self-righteous gore

Nothing paints memory
Like bloodsoaked hands
.
.
.
My boss told me
' His wife took everything
' After the divorce
' Died in a bar fight

' A good way to go
I paid respect

He looked at me
In accusation of insanity

A classic
Choke'n upon
Adrenaline spiked blood

No need for a pension
To fund that
.
.
.
I've rolled on
This future outcome
Of our Tech age

Will fortune
Cash out

For what I cast in
Fronted for the win
_

To build an archive
& Retain the past

That mistakes
May be avoided
Or reknewed

I don't ever
Want to choose
For another

But I do
Want them
To have a choice

Of which I labor
To inform them
.
.
.
Blunted Up
Ridgeside

Everyone else
Lakeside

Nobody gets high
Like me
Many have stated

Nobody get firewood
Like me
 Bons by default

The wood wet
Waterside where
The fallen reside

I search for ones
Fate placed

To be set free
From the
Slow rot of decay

To be placed in
Native American Ways

A funeral
Sung in glories
Of the flame

After the manner
Of the Star

From which
All were formed
_

The heart
A chunk of slate

To dry out
The wet twigs

Light Fluffy Core
The foundation
Of it all

Placed between
The laid Husband & Wife

Second Stage to become
The perched Four Siblings

These the two stages
Of Uinta bonfire pillars
.
