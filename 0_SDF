El Botanico
A cat refuge

Park deep wooded
In deep city

A place
Only portrayed
In fantasy

Cats inumerable
Carried themself locals

Curious this way or that
Go'n by one means or another

The old greenhouse
Built with a devotion
Which binds strength
To keep this park

Cats materialize'n
Over rafters & ledges
Stare'n from bush
Roll'n in packs
_

Buenos Aires
Valentines Day

The people stroll'n
Lovers in hand

Romance unmatched
_

A spirit lost
To the modern world

Yet in this
Remote land of
Argentina
Held treasured
.
.
.
If the govt is mad at me
Well I accept the consequences
Of live'n a lawless life

It is a part of me
I wish never taken away

Tho I may at times take liberty
In the freedom of my wishes
.
.
.
Europe
No cell
Nor plan

First time
O'r Atlantic

American
Rocky Mountains & Appalachians

Curious at
The Alpes

To view how worn
Was the old world
Consumed by man
.
.
.
Friends & Love
Can be lost long

But always return
To those who seek

Of all I meet
Till I returned home
Did I find the truth

Kindred sprinkled by destiny
To waypoints
Of how one should be
_

My cousin
Elijah's deeds

Only told
In first person

Which are equal
In comparison
To my own

How is it
After long seek
I find you again

Before alone
As a child

Now alone
As an adult

Back home
Kick'n it with you
_

I always disrespected my dad
He would say he was the shit
But he only rolled with family

I thought that
The lamest fault of all

In krews past count
Night after night
In different packs
Extend'n a recognition
City-wide
_

Now with fewer friends
But still friends

Elijah the only one
I cared to see

We talked on same lame topics
I'd shame my dad openly
_

Old age
I now know
Is learn'n

Dad right all along
& You played the fool

Cuban cigar
Sized blunt

31st Birthday
Hot boxed

JJ & Elijah

I choked-out first
Break'n to bich
Roll'n down window

The smoke
A giant cloud
Deompress'n

Over the houses
& To the sky
_

Codine coated blunts
Put me to shame
Tap'n out

Back to back blunts
Put me to shame
Tap'n out

Back my streets
For my birthday

& I got
Played a pussy
.
.
.
Wife & I
At different
Strengths & Weakness

Under pressure but
Took me off the mountain

In admiration I said
' I would have
' Flip'd the fk out
' Fk you
' Fk this
' Fk everything

She replied
' I work better
' Under pressure

Her research paper due
That night

' Send over what you have
' & I'll help you
I told her in gratitude

I opened her email
It only contained
The teacher's prompt

I write well
Under pressure

Die Hard 4

If you gonna be 1337
Be loud mouthed

& One day
Some Bruce-Willis muthrfkr

Bust in to-say
' Let's save the universe

& I'd know
I prepared all my life
_

Batman know
Robin needs to know
Their place

A ride to die
Kind of muthrfkr

This wave
Till its end

Self-sacrificed
In specific purpose
.
.
.
Omly

One look
One memory

Then they know

Muthrfkr cast
Apart from other

Your reaction
A tired route

Tho to you
Unique it seem

Off the wall
Blackest of sheep

Try to comprehend

I'll laugh
At your tumble

White razed black
Latin grown Mexican

American at the core

Southern raised
& Never tolerant

When some muthrkfkn
Northerner start shit

Fk false federation
Remember the cause

Independence

Rebel against
Two Faced Tyrants

Minorities proclaimed free
Tho cuffed they ever be

After natural rot
Of government power
.
.
.
Cultivated
Perpendicular to society

Adventure unfamiliar
In a net

Words outshined
By the glare

Hackers
Clicked away
_

Against the grain

Often I suspect
This my only motive

Or that it be
Excellence when unguided

Many paths
Numerous choices

Where whim meets wisdom
Subconscious instincts implemented

Alone as cleanroom
The reaction pure

Life in science
Record'n experience

Mad hat legit
My world a
Freaks show
.
.
.
Time precious
Stasis madden'n

Give me the
Liberty of mean'n

To cause movement
On the roll of life

Restrict me
In a space of no progress

Mutex Locked
Halted by 3rd-party

Drives me rabid
Prey caught in clutches
Give'n it all
For one last time
.
.
.
Losers
Rejected by all

My people

Us taken each
As an other

Know'n the
Other is
Okay with that

No fake'n
It along
With the rest

My legend
No delays

You serve the story
Or we go
Separate ways

Not selfish
Understand'n
Earthly ways

You
As featured

In the only story
You will be
Recorded in

First time
O'r The Atlantic

Vienna

All in cryptic
Austrian ways

Slovenia

Proved I knew
Nothing of Europe

When I seen
It existed on map

Ljublejaba
What kind a
Odd place is that

When you travel
On the whim

The city desolate
Words all gibberish

I always been
Scared of what
I regardless do

Put'n myself
Ever in position

To have to live
With hard choices

Cold Wet
No shelter

Shit'n
No paper
+

My simple theory
' If I can see it
' I can get there

A man listened

Us alone near
Secluded military lands

His look of
Unsettled incredibility

Due to my
Assured certainty
_

Storm cap'd peaks
Never permitted me

To truly test
That theory honestly

But regardless
I made way
.
.
.
Fk humility
When legit

Savor our moment
Cause you will
Always remember it

A unicorn
Mixed with a stray
Mangy mutt

Some people are
Too stupid
To understand
Reality as is

I have to
Explain myself

Which puts me
In awkward positions

Which I'm entirely
Accustomed too
.
.
.
Every summit

Loneliness unmasked

One thought over
Pinnacles of debate

Forgotten grounds
Immutable boulders

Trees all
Alpine runt

Beguiled to
A far-away desolation
_

Major players
In unix communities

Recognize me
Loon & half-baked

Odd outside
Standard lines

Deep & cold
In thicket paths

Snow in proof
Of no other

As deer
In WTF glares

Blunted Blazed
Ridgeside

They asked
Of my yoga

We performed
Sacrament
Around flame

Beef Jerky
No water

Moutain Dew
In one hit

Sunrise pose

Inhale blunt
Rise exhale smoke

Blaine the choo-choo-train

Let smoke out
Only in percentages
Inhale'n precentages


Solitary Ridgeside
Elune enshrouded
Late no light

All were blessed
With the cough
Share'n experience
As equals

Breathless moment
When a song
Understood

Mayhap bypassed
Plenty before

Freddie Gibbs
'Just Tryin Ta Make it

Birthed resolve
To succeed to Sneznik

A journey
Over many days

Against them locals
Aun to sneer
Prolcaim my failure

I smirk back

You

Mistaken faithless fks
As countless past

At the end
No where to find
To ball all over

So keep on
As I do

America
Bought only a traitor

To whistleblow
Our surveillent state

Not the confession
Of community neighbors
Busy in subversive-tasks

What a day
What a day

When only a Snowden
Cured our ignorant state

A much better hacker am I
& I not a Russian Spy

If the call rise
May it be for my name
Next time
.
.

Faith
A Fervor
Like Fire

Wanes at times

A blaze
Too costly
Aun for forests

Faith steady as
Simple red coal

Toasted tortillas
Enough to get by

Faith past coincidences
Sifted obvious product

Portland
Peaceful on Island

Boston
Busy & distant

Tired

Airport Bus empty
Arrive'n 8hrs early

'Superstorm Sandy
'Hit'n in a few hours

Airport get'n closed
Because a storm?

In Texas
We have hurricanes

I pressed on
Unimpressed

'We can get you out of here
'On a plane leaving in thirty mins

Fortune
Of the faithful

I was out fore the hour
On the last plane out
.
.

I roll
Big Bang
At back

Surf'n its waves
Dip'n or rise'n
In tune

Got places to be
Got plans to do

This than that
To get to
Calculated positions

Writers Voice
Well worn

Body in
Plumb pristine

Hope distilled clear

With that bite
Worse than anyother

Take me young
Take me faithful

Let the explosion
Of my end

Propel my bang
Loud to centuries

HiTech Ideas
Odd american talk
Classic adventure tales

Mary at my side
Pack at my back

Inform'n on what
I wished informed

Master of my own
Among subjugated masses

'An old say'n
'In Texas
'That says

'fool me once
'shame on
'shame on you

'fool me...

Texan is to live badass

Maybe bigger in bias relation
But relations are only relative

Never trust
Another's perspective

Hella awesome how
Texans keep Texas

So each day lived
Like it the last

Hacker
In an anti-hacker state

Crocker
The first hacker I knew

Lived alone at the 'park
Found 1337 thru insomnia
Book by book he read

The FBI expelled
Him from all universities

After Novell told the government
Who was told by the schools admin
Who was told by Croker himself

Report'n a hole that opened
Free access to the network

A typical story
In hacker circles

Omniscient power
Is power over ignorants
_

My country whines
Why are Russian hackers better?

As it maliciously treats
Wizards as witches

Inject'n my traffic
With packets

As they conspire
To manufacture
Probable warrants
_

So what is a
Muthrfkr to do

That is too Texan
To leave america

Just try to be good enough
To get outta any situation

Russians may have
Well fed hackers

But true is beauty
Where naught else blooms

Input & Output
Of this command center
A massive organ array

We slave to eat

Stocked as material
Only as inventory

Fate
Will loop round

Mechanics of this motion
Longsince set

Trump Election
Thunderbolt sent by god
The universe or whatever

To crack open the earth
To be filled by our dead

Answer of pooled prayers
Of creatures worldwide
For destruction of mankind

Rattlesnakes
Expect & accept death

Death the meat
Of its substance

Nobly
Find'n death themself

Sure as shit sticks
Better decapitate

Caz four hours
After death

It may get chance
To strike death

Turn'n victor to victim

Life is something
That comes & goes

At the end
I hope as

Pheonix I fly

All flame
In sudden glory

Then to darkness
Of the night

'Fuck the world
I'd first seen this sentence

On my wife's chinese shirt
Fate's message

My catch phrase now
'Fk the world

'Fk the world
'How did I mess
'It all up again

Often sentiment
Felt in my life

Bear'n
My excited smirk

Out there in
A world alone

That is what
I be best at

Let youth
Give me momentum
To fly

Didn't belong anywhere
Bury me best right here

Event at the apex
Life horizons death

It is death
That tells

2 Yr Mission
2000 Mi Trail

Never once believed
I'd make the end

Now again
All false faith
Stripped from me

Failure
An empty sound
After my words
Are distributed abundantly

But I keep write'n
As I kept preach'n & hike'n

Cause the means
My favorite part

Skills
Matter most in life

Relationships end
Drugs can't create

Money flows
Best fresh like water

All things I need
I dont like

Hammock pack laptop
Bore of a chore

Been so cold
Thought I was die'n

All such times
Overshadowed

By flamboyant past

What fate
Keeps me upon
Wings of luck

To this day

I hit black

But my peanut skull
Uncracked

Head hit'n

Continue'n 40 Yards

Vienna Courtgrounds

Enchant'n
Places to write

Birds play out
Their day-to-day game

Admiration of foreigners
At every turn

Those of statue
Cast by deed
Entropy hard erases

Can my words
Last longer

Value
In time-old tales

Adventures
Regardless of time nor region

Much more admirable
Than those dainty-smug-fks

Back home
Corpus Christi

My neighborhood grocer

As crack town square

Of shady places

Here holds true
The auora of
Shady places

Fascinating
How some places
Never change

Years
After the incident

Camilla told me
'Yea you did
'You flew over the car

'Oh yea
A faded memory
Look'n down over
The car & street

Dazed & Confused
Find'n my way
Fifteen feet back

Consumed only
By the status
Of my lil-sis

Fine by bike
Ambulance only take'n me

Thank god
I decided prudence

Against go'n wild
Down the street
From that light

Appalachian Epic of 3SHOT
MKRX Systems

A hacker weekend
Can change a
Monumental Project

Into well & done
Right-off-the-back

Plenty of
Coffee

Plenty of
Bud

Guided as if by
Poltergeist hands

Shade pass'n thru
As-with one last chance
To make amends
That they channel
Through me

I have given
All I had to give
To everything in life

Of this
I am at
True peace

America
Police State

Life under powerful sects
Rule hardhandedly

Administrative Thugs
Unioned Federally

I believed
I would leave

But American is what I am
American to whatever end
.
.
.
Wrote a book
Published a bit

But most I can ever do
Is leave it on a trail

To the side underneath
What looks to be
A few days drift
.
.
.
Divergent trajectories
Momentary uncertainties

That drag consequences
To infinities

Know'n this or that
Spark towards ends
Obscured by time

Daily decisions
Dramatic in rewards
_

Saturday uncertain
In end decided

I'd go to the
Local university
& Use their gym

I saw legs
At a vending machine
In the distance

Approach'n
I remembered
In a panic

My milkshake needed ice
From the cafeteria
On the other side of school

These weight gainers
Were slightly work'n
Distracted on how
I'd finally amassed

Legs in the distance
Leave'n the vending machine

Prompted
To pursue again

Invited her too meet me
Over at the gym

Chinese
Know fireworks

Since the moment
She showed up

Been whole-concentrated on
How to hold-on

Reshaped into an idol
Of Chinese Buddah
Merry & Fat

I have unshakable faith
Aun a knowledge of proofs
That science the truth

My fate
Gonna-be great

Tho happy as happy can be
Life aint all about that

Pain is my meat
That sustains momentum

In complete contradiction
Debates drowned down

Pleasantly drawn
As a siren sings

Aun think of Adventure
As good-riddance

Ducki
My wife

The epitome of
A magical companion

Her actions defy
Logical bounds

I ask something
& It magically appears

Fix'n an audio-issue
On a recent
cli to xwindows
Ubuntu Linux server

Retrieve'n
Needles in haystacks

Soul sparkle'n
As pure diamond
True happiness

Food all my life
I hated as nucsiance

Morph'd to a blessing
I became enlightened to
Higher states of being

The world
Takes Texans
Easily as assholes

Austria
Talk'n to whomever

People openly speak
Of what they
Want to be remembered

This Syrian
Evicted from home

War torn by
My nation's interests

Thru Turkey
By pack
Over wilderness
To Austria

Who Austrians
Took humanely
As refugee

I held him
With great respect

Inevitably
He took me
As an asshole
.
.
.
All-In bluff
Bloats life sized

Consequences
World-break'n

From such blimps
I plunge
Erratic down

Grasp'n air
Not let'n go

Be what manner
In the end
Always alive

Gamble unspent
Still hot streaks
Must be played
To more-glorious ends

I cast in completely
But life reels me back

Mayhap reserved
For bigger game
.

Always wellread helpful
But never sufficent

Glory demands
Trial by faith

To walk blindly
In likely ridicule

To theoretical ends
& Proclaim yourself

Conqueror

Seem'n alone

Plentiful times

Summer Adriactic morn
On Italian coasts
Via train until
Night in Alpes
Caught by blizzard

Late night
Innsbruck

Umbrella wrecked
From Sneznik

Wild ground far
From city center

I swung damp & cold
When water just broke snow

Mists soak thru
Regardless of tarp

Welcome I greeted
The snowy morn
.
.
.
Not plan'n
Always the plan

A loose leaf
On change'n winds

Powwow to befriend
A temporary associate

Water
From tap or spring

Food
Packed on back

Bed
Deep in woods
At clever position

Sleep
Under shelter
Or not at all

Naught guaranteed

Difficult experiences
Drown'd low till
Feel'n lost

Cold hardened
Sun tested

Seasons swallowed
In the infinite
Of the moment
.
.
.
'Fk the world
Spontaneous Spurts

I always
Relied upon
To ready me
For a new turn

Still get spurts now
Tho they fall unheeded

I never had
Life like this before

If you never stole food
Then you do not know

A life
With so much Ball
