Torrential rains
Ran me out my tent

To a table
Under cover of the shelter

My tent was flooded
In inches

Hawk Mtn Shelter occupied:

Bathsalts 
& Dead Horse Beard

Roadwarrior 
& Jonathan

Juice 
& Orange

& Some other ppl
Which play no parts in this story

Of all
I was the only one 
Travel’n alone

v
Roadwarrior

At over 6ft tall
His eyes gave a confident 
Gleam of domination

He had to finish
By a certain date
Every day of the hike was planned

As I copied key mileage 
From Roadwarrior’s books
I asked

‘ What does the word Blazes mean 
 ‘ In this book

‘ Those White Blazes you been following
‘ Marked on the trees

Someone said clearly incredulous

I'd seen marks
Blue White & Orange

‘ Amicola is an 
‘ Approach trail
‘ That's why it was blue
‘ Only the Appalachian Trail
‘ Is White Blazed
Dead Horse Beard
Clarified

Everyone looked at me
Like I was a
Loon or a Liar

v
Orange & Juice 
Bickered nonstop

One asked if I also believed
That the other was being too Anti-social
& Should apologize 
For the embarassment
It had caused everyone

I felt grateful to be alone
v

v
Army Rangers were up 
All night train’n
Throw'n live grenades

Close enough for me
To be worried

I drank their water
Makes us even
