‘ If the fool would
‘ Persist in his folly
‘ He would become wise

Still far from wise
I leave that to the elderly

Those afraid to venture
Over the ramble of mistakes

In the odessey
Towards new answers

The recipe to taste
Delight in ones life

Nights spent
On hard strange grounds

Days choose’n
Doors to divergent trajectories

If I were to be wise
I’d teach

‘ Life has no mistakes

You are either dead
Or you aren’t
_

Complete in despair
Lost in the jungle

‘ You estimate yourself
‘ With such arrogance

‘ Let me back
‘ Into my American cage

‘ & There learn gratitude
‘ For the simple things

‘ & Die some time
‘ Other than now
.

No race accepts me
No social body kindred

I only know how to treat others
As strangers

Someone seen
In the blur of a passerby

Someone only understood
After they are
Nameless in memories

Memories a sea
Of the-such

Waves crest
Of longlost faces

Glimmer’n in
What made them unique

Flicker’n with
The clarity of reflected sun
.
.
.
No one who knows me
Could deny my intelligence

A restless mind
Caught up in union
With an untame heart

The anarchy of nature
A neverend’n story

Together tho polar
We sing these
‘ Songs of Myself
.
.
