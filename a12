Eat'n lunch
With Bathsalts & DHB

I discovered on their map

Only Blood Mtn lay between
Me & my first resupply

The promise of pizza
Pass'd me over that mtn
Like it was a small hill

Tales had been told
Since I first arrived in Atlanta

About this Pizza

Found at the first stop
They charge hardly anything

Anything you want
Piled on top
Baked hot in the oven
Specific to your order

I caught the store workers
As they tried close'n early

‘ Where do I order pizza

He pointed back behind the rack
Of candy bars & beef jerky

I looked back confused

‘ Its in the top door
( Obviously )

The fabled pizza
Was a $2 Walmart Pizza
Quadruple priced

Roadwarrior looked at me with
What I could only perceive
As unpleasantness

He jumped on Jonathan
For keep’n his pace slow

I decided to help support this hostel 
Reek’n of piss & dust

It made its living 
Only for this trail

How rare to do that
In the mountains

That night was magical
That will forever glow

Roadwarrior & Jonathan
Bathsalts & DBH
& Some others

All of us
After the first days of adventure
