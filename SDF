Deep wooded
Deep city park

A place
Only in fantasy

Buenos Aires
Valentines Day

The people stroll'n
Lovers in hand

Romance unmatched
_

A spirit lost
To the modern world

Yet in this
Remote land
Held treasured
.
.
.
If the govt is mad at me
Well I accept the consequences
Of live'n a lawless life

It is a part of me
I wish never taken away

Tho I may at times take liberty
In the freedom of my wishes
.

Europe
No cell
Nor plan

First time
O'r Atlantic

American
Rocky Mountains & Appalachians

Curious at

Friends & Love
Can be lost long
But will always return
To those who seek

Of all I meet
Not till I returned home
Did I find

Truth kindred
Sprinkled by Destiny

To waypoints
Of how one should be
_

Many songs writ
& Stories told
Of my deeds

Elijah my closest cousin
His deeds
Only told in first person

Which are equal
In comparison
To my own

How is it
That in my long seek
I find you again

Alone as when
I was a child

Now alone
As an adult
Back home
_

I always disrespected my dad
He would say he was the shit
But he only ever rolled with family

I thought that
The lamest fault of all

More krews than
Count on one hand

Night after night
In different packs
_

Now with fewer friends
But still friends

Elijah the only one
I cared to see

We talked
About the same lame topics
I'd shame my dad for
_

Old age
I now know

Is learn'n
Dad right all along
& You played the fool

Cuban cigar
Sized blunt

31st Birthday
Hot boxed

JJ & Elijah

I choked out first
Break'n to chicken
Roll'n down window

The smoke
A giant cloud
Deompress'n

Over the houses
& To the sky
_

Codine coated blunts
Put me to shame
Tap'n out

Back to back blunts
Put me to shame
Tap'n out

Back to the streets
For my birthday
& I got played a pussy

Wife & I
At different
Strengths & Weakness

Under pressure but
Took me off the mountain

In admiration I said
' I would have
' Flip'd the fk out
' Fk you, fk this, fk everything

She replied
' I work better
' Under pressure

Her research paper due
That night

' Send over what you have
' & I'll help you
I told her in gratitude

I opened her email
It only contained
The teacher's prompt

Die Hard 4

If you gonna be 1337
Be loud mouthed

& One day
Some Bruce Willis muthrfkr

Bust in to say
' Let's save the universe

& I'd know
I prepared all my life

Batman knows
Robins
Know their place

A ride to die
Kind of muthrfkr

This wave
Till its end

In hopeful washout
.
.
.
All I need
One look
One memory

Then they know
Muthrfkr cast
Apart from rest

Your reaction
A tired route

Tho to you
Unique it seem

Off the wall
Blackest of sheep

Try to understand
I'll laugh
At your tumble

White razed black
Latin grown Mexican

American at the core

Southern raised
& Never tolerant
When some muthrkfkn
Northerner think they shit

Fk this federation
Remember the cause

Rebel against
Two Faced Tyrants

Minorities proclaimed free
Tho cuffed they ever be
.
.
.
Cultivated
Perpedicular to society

Adventure unfamiliar
In a net

Words outshined
By the glare

Hackers
Clicked away
_

Against the grain
Black sheep

Often I suspect
This my only motive

Or that it be
Excellence when unguided

Many paths
Numerous choices

Where whim meets wisdom
Subconcious instincts unearthed

Alone
Cleanroom

The reaction pure
Wastes of reaction

In that earthly circle
Action feeds another

To be always as able
But never squandered
.
.
.
Time precious
Stasis madden'n

Give me the
Liberty of mean'n

To cause movement
On the roll of life

Restrict me
In a space of no progress

Mutex Locked
Halted by 3rd-party
.
.
.
Losers
Rejected by all

My people

Us taken each
As an other

Know'n the
Other is
Okay with that

No fake'n
It along
With the rest

My legend
No delays

You serve the story
Or we go
Separate ways

Not selfish
Understand'n
Earthly ways

Not the man
Of my city

That time passed

Ranger
Off the grid

In foreign lands
Full of fear

First time
O'r The Atlantic

Vienna

I didn't know
Of Austria

Apart that
They spoke Austrian

Slovenia
Made me realize
I knew nothing of Europe

When I seen
It existed on a map

Ljublejaba
What kind a
Odd place is that

When you travel
On the whim

The city desolate
Words all gibberish

I always been
Scared of what
I regardless do

Put'n myself
Ever in position

To have to live
With hard choices

Cold
Wet no shelter

Shit'n
No paper runs
+
My simple theory
' If I can see it
' I can get there

A man listened

Us alone near
Secluded military lands

His look of
Unsettled incredibility

Due to my
Assured certainty

Tho the storms
Centered on the mountains

Never permitted me
To truly test
That theory
.
.
.
Fk humility
When legit

Savor our moment
Cause you will
Always remember it

A unicorn
Mixed with a stray
Mangy mutt

Some people are
Too stupid
To understand

I have to
Explain myself

Which puts me
In awkward positions
Which I'm entirely
Accustomed too
.
.
.
Every summit
Loneliness unmasked

One thought over
Pinnacles of debate

Forgotten grounds
Immutable boulders

Trees all
Alpine runt

Beguiled to
A far away desolation
_

Major players
In unix communities

Recognize me
Loon & half-baked

Odd outside
The standard lines

Deep & cold
In thicket paths

Snow in proof
Of no other

Blunted Blazed & Ridgeside

They asked
Of my yoga

We performed
Sacrament

Around flame
Of fire

Beef Jerky
No water
Is never fun

Then the chug
Moutain Dew
In one hit

Sunrise pose
Inhale blunt
Rise exhale smoke

Blaine the choo choo train
Let smoke out
Only in percentages
Inhale'n precentages


Solitary Ridgeside
Elune enshrouded
Late no light

All were blessed
With the cough

Breathless moment
When a song
Is understood

Mayhap bypassed
Plenty before

Freddie Gibbs
'Just Tryin Ta Make it

Birthed resolve
To succeed to Sneznik

A journey
That took many days

Against them locals
Aun to sneer
But I succeded

Sneer me
I smirk back

You

Mistaken faithless fks
As countless past

At the end
No where to find
To ball up on
.

America
Bought only a traitor

To whistleblow
On its surveillent state

Not the confession
Of community neighbors
Busy in subversive-tasks

What a day
What a day

When only a Snowden
Cured our ignorant state

A much better hacker am I
& I not a Russian Spy

If the call rise
May it be for my name
Next time

Faith
A Fervor
Like Fire
Wanes at times

A blaze
Too costly
Aun for forests

Faith as
Simple red coal

Toasts tortillas well
.
.

Faith past coincidences
Sifted obvious product

Portland
Peaceful on Island

Boston
Busy & distant

Tired

Airport Bus empty
Arrive'n 8hrs early

'Superstorm Sandy
'Hit'n in a few hours

The airport is closed
Because of a storm?

In Texas
We have hurricanes

I pressed on
Unimpressed

'We can get you out of here
'On a plane leaving in thirty mins

Fortune
Of the faithful

I roll in life
Like the
Big Bang
At my back

Got places to be
Got plans to do

This than that
To get to
Calculated positions

With Writers Voice
Well worn

Body
In a plumb pristine

Hope'n not fermented
Distilled clear as water

With that bite
Worse than anyother

Take me young
Take me faithful

Let the eplosion
Of my end

Propel my bang
Loud to centuries

HiTech Ideas
Odd american talk
Classic adventure tales

Mary at my side
Pack at my back

Inform'n
On what I wished informed

Master of my own
Among subjugated masses

'An old say'n
'In Texas
'That says

'fool me once
'shame on
'shame on you

'fool me...
'i can't get fooled again

Texan is to live badass

Maybe bigger in bias relation
But relations are only relative

So why should we trust
Your perspective

On how fkn awesome
Texans keep Texas

More than likely

So each day lived

Merit means most
To most

Merit much
But now 
Isn't time

To sidetrack
On petty runs
For payment

All I need
Is what 
I can make
A story out of

Just give me whatever
I'll figure something out

Sit'n on deer shit

I try my best
To write

In the manner
Of my light sway'n

Bobb'n in brisk walk
Exhuberant of expression

Tell'n you something
You will always remember

In a fashion that
Is polite only second

Till past time
After all-else lost

The jackass lost
Purged out
All of it

The message
In ephipany hits

~You are an asshole

Whole house enraged

That message to our broswers

'We were get'n it for free

Guilty as charged

Hacker
In an anti-hacker state

Crocker the first hacker I knew
Lived alone at the 'park
Found 1337 thru insomnia
Book by book he read

The FBI expelled
Him from all universities

After Novell told the government
Who was told by the schools admin

Who was told by Croker himself
Report'n a hole that opened
Free access to the network

A typical story
In hacker circles

Omniscient power
Is power over ignorants
_

My country whines
Why are Russian hackers better?

As it maliciously treats
Wizards as witches

Inject'n my traffic
With packets

As they conspire
To manufacture
Probable warrants
_

So what is a
Muthrfkr to do

That is too Texan
To leave america

Just try to be good enough
To get outta any situation

Russians may have
Well fed hackers

But true is beauty
Where naught else blooms

Overrun by
Lizardly look'n tech-dorks
That excel in press'n buttons

Input & Output
A massive organ array

Prince of Archives
Since '14

No longer
About file lust

A greater need presents itself
Independence of Humanity

Our anonymous right

But I look
To the poor beasts
We slave to eat

Stocked as material
Only as inventory

Fate
Will loop round

The mechanics of its motion
Longsince set

Trump Election
Thunderbolt sent by god
The universe or whatever

To crack open the earth
To be filled by our dead
_

Rattlesnakes
Expect & accept death

Death is the meat
Of its substance

Nobly
It finds death itself

& Sure as shit sticks
Better decapitate

Caz four hours
After death
It may get chance
To strike death

Turn'n victor to victim
.
.
.
Life is something
That comes & goes

At the end
I hope as
Pheonix I fly

All flame
In sudden glory

Then to darkness
Of the night
_

'Fuck the world
I'd first seen this sentence

On my wife's chinese shirt
Fate's message

My catch phrase now
'Fuck the world

'Fk the world
'How did I mess
'It all up again

Often sentiment
That goes with
My excited smirk

Out there in
A world alone

That is what
I be best at

Let youth
Give me momentum
To fly

Didn't belong anywhere
Bury me best right here

Event at the apex
Life horizons death

It is death
That tells

A man's Tale

2 Yr Mission
2000 Mi Trail

Never once believed
I'd make the end

Now again
All false faith
Stripped from me

Failure
An empty sound
After my words
Are distributed abundantly

But I keep write'n
As I kept preach'n & hike'n

Cause the means
My favorite part
.
.
.
Skills
Matter most in life

Relationships end
Drugs can't create

Money flows
Best fresh like water

Things
All the things I need
I dont like

Hammock, pack, laptop
_

Been so cold
Thought I was die'n

& Those times
Are greatly overshadowed

What fate
Keeps me upon
Wings of luck

To this day
I knew I hit black

But my peanut skull
Uncracked

I remember my head hit'n
Asphalt at 70mi+

Motorcyle continue'n on
40 Yards

To smash into
A complete total
Against concrete wall
.

Vienna Courtgrounds

Enchant'n
Places to write

The birds play out
Their day-to-day game

Admiration of foreigners
At ever turn

Those of statue
Cast in with a deed
Entropy hard erases

Can my written word
Last longer

Value seen
In time-old tales

Adventures
Regardless of time nor region

Much more admirable
Than these dainty-smug-fks

Went back home
To Corpus Christi

At my old
Neighborhood grocer
Down the street

Crack-Town Square

Of shady places
I ever been
Here holds true

It is fascinating
How some places
Never change
.

Years
After the incident

Camilla told me
'Yea you did
'You flew over the car

'Oh yea
A faded memory
Look'n down over
The car & street

Dazed & Confused
Find'n my way back
Fifteen feet away

Consumed only
By the status
Of my lil-sis

Fine by bike
Ambulance only take'n me
_

Thank god
I decided prudence

Against go'n wild
Down the street
From that light

Appalachian Epic of 3SHOT
MKRX Systems

A hacker weekend
Can change a
Monumental Project

Into a well & done
Right off the back

Plenty of
Coffee

Plenty of
Bud

Guided as if by
Poltergeist hands

Something passing through
As with one last chance
To make amends
That they channel
Through me

I have given
All I had to give
To everything in life

Of this
I am at true peace

America
Police State

Life under powerful sects
Rule hardhandedly

Administrative Thugs
Unioned Federally

I believed
I would leave

But American is what I am
American to whatever end
.
.
.
Wrote a book
Published a bit

But most I can ever do
Is leave it on a trail

To the side
Underneath what looks to be
A few days drift
.
.
.
Divergent Trajectories
Momentary uncertainties

That drag consequences
To infinities

Know'n this or that
Spark towards ends
Obscured by time

Daily decisions
Dramatic in rewards
_

Saturday uncertain
In end decided

I'd go to the
Local university
& Use their gym

I saw legs
At a vending machine
In the distance

Approach'n
I remembered in a panic

My milkshake needed ice
From the cafeteria
On the other side of school

These weight gainers
Were slightly work'n

Distracted on how 
I'd finally amassed

Legs in the distance
Leave'n the vending machine

Prompted
To pursue again

Invited her too meet me
Over at the gym

Chinese
Know fireworks

Since the moment
She showed up

Been whole-concentrated on
How to hold-on

Reshaped into an idol
Of Chinese Buddah
Merry & Fat

I have unshakable faith
Aun a knowledge of proofs
That science the truth

My fate
Gonna-be great

Tho happy as happy can be
Life aint all about that

Pain is my meat
That sustains momentum

In complete contradiction
Debates drowned down

Pleasantly drawn
As a siren sings

Aun think of Adventure
As good-riddance

Ducki
My wife

The epitome of
A magical companion

Her actions defy
Any logical bounds

I ask something
& It magically appears

Fix'n an audio-issue
On a recent
cli to xwindows
Ubuntu Linux server

Retrieve'n
'A needle in a haystack

Soul sparkle'n
As pure diamond
True happiness

Food all my life
I hated as nucsiance

Morph'd to a blessing
I became enlightened to
Higher states of being
.

The world
Takes Texans
Easily as assholes

Austria
Talk'n to whomever

People openly speak
Of what they
Want to be remembered

This evicted Syrian

War torn by
My nation's interests

Thru Turkey
By pack
Over wilderness
To Austria

Who Austrians
Took humanely
As refugee

I held him
With great respect

Inevitably
He took me
As an asshole

All-In Bluff
Bloated life sized

Consequences
World-break'n

From such blimps
I plunge 
Erratic down

Grasp'n air
Not let'n go

Be what manner
In the end
Always alive

Gamble not up
Hot streaks
Must be played
To more-glorious ends

I cast in completely
But life reels me back

Mayhap reserved
For bigger game
.

Always wellread
Helpful but never sufficent

Glory demands
Trial by faith

To walk blindly
In likely ridicule

To theoretical ends
& Proclaim yourself 
Conqueror

Make three

Only friends

Like a Friday

Plentiful times

Summer Adriactic morn
On Italian coasts
Via train until
Night in Alpes
Caught by May blizzard

Late night
Innsbruck

Umbrella wrecked
From Sneznik

Wild ground far
From city center

I swung damp & cold
When water just broke snow

Mists soak thru
Regardless of tarp

Welcome I greeted
The snowy morn
.
.
.
Not plan'n
Always the plan

A loose leaf
On change'n winds

Powwow to befriend
A temporary associate

Water
From tap or spring

Food
Packed on back

Bed
Deep in woods
At clever position

Sleep
Under shelter
Or not at all

Naught guaranteed

Difficult experiences
Drown'd low till
Feel'n lost

Cold hardened
Sun tested

Seasons swallowed
In the infinite
Of the moment
.
.
.
'Fk the world
Spontaneous Spurts

I always relied on
To ready me for a new turn

Still get them now
Tho they fall unheeded

I never had
Life like this before

If you never stole food
Then you do not know

A life
With so much Ball
