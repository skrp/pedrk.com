Cross’n into New York
On open mellow ridges

Vast expanses
Of the wilderness 
Unimaginable

Late sun
A gentle orange

3Chop naturally sure
Paths always true

Thru rain
Dry plains
Dark’n forests
Unend’n climbs

This lifestyle brought out
Her prime characteristics

Tho impractical in society
True gems of humanity

Travel’n in a team
Means much less individual items to carry

3Chop & 3Shot
Not a duo to fk with

Both with mace
Her with a menace’n machete
I & my military tomahawk

Warpaint
On our face

Naught between you

Naught shield’n you
From late night gusts

Nor to ward off
The trickles of early morn whimpers

Fate to walk by
A statue
Of Walt Whitman

What magnificent tales

3Chop 
Look’d past homeless

At a corporate resupply

A mailwoman kindly 
Came to talk with us

Then stuck a $5 
In 3Chop’s hand

Rapidly say’n 
While run’n away

‘ I wish 
‘ I could do more 
‘ But I have 5 kids

We had to guiltily 
Spend the sacrifice
On an
Icecream Sandwich 
Eat’n contest

Afterwhich
I was title’d
Pussy

Only one pot
Only one spoon

That is how we ate
I always ate first
