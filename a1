The Appalachian Trail
My great trial

Like the natives
Of whose blood I share

In ritual I pass thru
Great ordeal
To emerge a man

To the North
From sunrise to the right
Till it set at the left

Each step
A new step

A simple life
With a peaceful mind

To hike an unbroken
Pathway of mountain

From Georgia
2000mi 
To Maine

There to seek
The ominous mountain

Natives named in reverence
Katahdin
