I rose like I had everyday since
Gather'n wood for the breakfast fire

I also mistakenly
Gathered a snake

The copperhead sleepy still

I kicked Christina awake
Threw her machete at her
Command’n her to kill it

The snake woke real fast
As Christina missed

They fought thru the bramble

The copperhead strike'n
Christina miss'n

Despite the undergrowth
Christina kept her focus

The snake dove
 Into a leap'n strike

The machete SHINK
Split the air

The open-mouthed head
Severed from its body

Spin’n out into the distance

3Chop held the severed body
With one hand

Then peeled down
The copperhead's skin
Off with the other

3Chop tore out the guts
Washed the twitch'n corpse
 In the river

Built a fire
Roast'd the unseasoned meat
& Ate

3Chop & 3Shot
A memorable Duo
Throughout 400mi of Appalachian Mtn

My parents firmly declared
I would not own a Motorcycle
Aun with my own money

But my tongue was
Forged of silver
3mo later at Seventeen

Cruise'n on my
Cherry Red Triumph Legend 900cc
Paid in full by my parents

My sister Megan
On back
That sleepy Sunday afternoon
In Texas

Our parents in the van behind
All on the road to our cousins

A Ford Mustang
Pulled up aside

Its engine call'n me out
Disrespectfully

On green we lurched forward
Leave'n my startled parents
In the wake of fumes

I kept our race parallel
This road had an interest'n fate

The Mustang
Screeched & Skidded

As its lane turn'd
Then ended abruptly
