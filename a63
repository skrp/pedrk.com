3Chop wasn’t womanly

I had to step up
To the chore

Cook’n Clean’n 
Console’n Bitch’n

3Chop would in dreary silence
Accept her situation & Hike On

I cooked from my pot
Just enough for two

Placed upon the embers of fire
The bottom always burns the food

Instead of all that work & waste 
Of scrape’n it out

Respectful mice
Always clean’d it
In time for morn

Only ever once
Leave’n scat
V
V
V
In a shelter 
In New Jersey

All dryness & backyards

Christina patch’d her blisters

An old lady lent over 
A gauze roll

She thought Christina
Was going to steal it

Paranoia
The gift of foresight

Separate’n us 
Man & Beast

The grips of it
An ever tight’n vice

When my little sister
Takes longer than calculations

Those miles
Always back down the mountain
In a rapid panic

I would see her
After have’n thought
I’d never see her again
