I
Canadian Canola flowers
Expand to the Horizon
Under grand fluffs
Of peaceful sky

The road rolls
I glide on by

Welcome’n yellows below
Friendly blues above
Breach Infinities

Towards those impossibilities
I go

Thru canyons of
Utah Idaho 
Wyoming Montana 
Alberta

Each unique
Each created by the
Chaos & consistence of Time

Open expanses of
road dirt
crop water
sky

To foliage lush
& Vibrance of mountainside

End’n in crisp nights
Aside my motorcycle machine
.
.
.
Amerith
Our trophy German Shepherd
Went rabid over a thicket
At the foothills of the
Wasatch Mountains

On the way back
I decided to inspect the spot

What I first thought
Were sticks too numerous
To be bones

Were bones so numerous
 One would think
They were sticks
_

Evil
This thicket
Where the Mtn Lion hauled
Its frightened meal

Criminal
Its infantile prey
Stolen in the deep of night

Devour'd
In the comfort of this den
.
.
.
My newest addition
To my harem of machines
Is wait’n for me after work

I can't wait
To peel off her box
Plug in
& Press her special button

That is
If I don't get distracted
With her Double Dvi
Eye-candy first

Either way
She will be whir’n
With the excitement
Under a deep heat sink

Excitement
No amount of 230 fans
Could temper

Probably have to go down
& Liquid cool off
That sensitive little processor

It's a give & take relationship
But it gets us thru
.
