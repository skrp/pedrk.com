Watuga
Built near a town
That lays at the bottom 
Of its manmade lake

Two hoodlums & I 
Met at the rope swing

They got me a contact
To get my own supply

High 
I spent my only afternoon
Dehydrated on the trail
_

Until I went to camp
Far below to the only 
Acceptable water source

Alone in those depths

Large dark things
Prowl’d curiously 
Near my tent

The story of my christen’n
Came before me

Tho I knew there was no one
More than a day ahead of me

Some would finish my story
Before I could tell it

All would consider me 
With reservations

Zero Day
Day alloted to Repose

An incredible day
For one weary

To those on budget
My fund'n only my tax refund

Each tick of time
A grain of worry upon my
Mission & Budget

A teacher off for summer
A crazed man Provisions
& I prepared lunch 

I decided the season
Was ideal for firemake'n

The teacher traded me
8 Snickers 
For my cook'n fuel

I took the bold challenge
Cook’n from fires only

Naturally clean'n
Litter from the ground

In Damascus
A community fat 

On the traffic
Of the trail

They had a nice library
The most important location
For any traveler

Wander'n the streets
Look'n for something
Cheap to eat

Roadwarrior & I
Crossed paths

The third episode 
Of his complete
Bewilderment

The third zero day
Ruined by my face

I was sleep'n in a bush either way
Might as well be in the isolated mountains

He declined 
To pass the night with me
Tho I had a blaze of bonfire

He hadn’t had time 
To make a single fire
