Pennsylvania

Sweet forests
Small trees 
Clutterless grounds

One could as simply walk 
Into the forest
As easy as the path

These are the forests 
Envisioned in fantasy

Hills never break'n 2,000ft

Dry breezy summer days
All in moderate display

Enter: Trail Angel

Past 6pm & go'n strong
Warpaint on my face
Testify'n this lifestyle

With that fuzzy ruggedness people respect
Shirtless I break onto a back road

A car stop’d 
A lady & a dog

I lay out my hook
‘ Is there a store near here

‘ Oh no, not for miles
The woman said clearly concerned

That is my number-one hook
It makes them realize

#1 
There isn't a store in walk’n distance
#2
I want food but not ask’n

Its an instant & unanimous
Hack of humanity

Allow’n a comfortable way
For them to give me
Whatever food they have

‘ I have no food on me
‘ Or I'd give you some

The lady now more concerned

‘ Its fine
I assure her
I begin to take leave
 
‘ I am only low on snacks
‘ My pack food will be fine

Resolved the woman said
‘ I'll drop you some groceries in the morn
‘ Just tell me where & when

She wouldn’t let me back out
I felt terribly guilty

We arranged to meet
8:30am the next day
