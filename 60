Enter’n Miller High

Black & Mexican hoods
Conjoined to one school

I quickly asserted
That I must be
& Nothing else
_

Each morn
The 30mins prior school
 With the goths
Smoke’n in the graveyard

At lunch time
Never caught sit’n alone
Cause I was never still
.
.
.
I had met Anthony
Dure’n a wrestle
With my only friend Jack
In middle school
_

Jason a gangly
Metalhead

Always armed with
A tennis racket

After learn’n
He lived on
North Beach

I invited myself over

There is always
A bond after you invite
Yourself over
_

Rear stairwells
Miller High

I manufactured the meet’n
Of Athony & Jason

Magnetic
Were kindred forces
That united & kept that bond

Freshman year
First year to establish
That Four Year Rep

That will carry
The best years of your life

When all regulations
Are avoidable

Teen & Untame

Isac
Alone at lunch

I invited him over

That day
I invited myself over

Turns out he was
Stevo’s best friend

Jason Anthony & I
Stevo & Isac
Juan & Joe

The Rejeck Crew
.
.
.
Juan helped

At the pricipals office

I had been sent there
Often for suspension

He had no friends
I can always tell

The only other requirement
To be enlisted
Was if he would follow

I invited him over
I invited myself over

8:30am
Tuesday morn

‘ Let’s skip to
‘ North Beach

I inspired
A pack of 6
Groggy kids

‘ We have to get Anthony
Brenda said

After we picked him up
We crossed the road
& Were swiftly handcuffed
Off to jail

That is how
I met Stevo

Once you get cuffed together
There is a certain bond
.
