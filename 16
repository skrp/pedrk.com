Oh that night on the open road
The only road continue’n North

There at
Indian Cabins Beer & Liquor

The owner exhibited gold
He sifted from a nearby stream

To a speculate’n
Province Surveyor

I spectated
Despite the owners distrust

The surveyor asked where
I was headed

He took me in
With his eyes for a time

You best buy
Yourself some beer

This is an isolated place
Of unsatiated alcoholism

I'll take you as far
As the 60th Parallel North

There you will be left
To Mercy & Mosquitoes

Hold that beer high
Promote it with all you've got

Mayhap this night
You will find yourself in Yellowknife

Howbeit, if you are stuck
At the 60th Parallel

Naught a sign nor house
Within 600 kilometers

Be grateful
Here the sun never sets

Be grateful
For your twelve pack

Two officers of 14 years
Lied in court
That I fought them

For justification to arrest me
Cause I was irritated
With a Transit Cop front'n up to me

Granted I did troll them
Before the hearing
As only a master could

Several months later
After the internal investigations filed
I saw the Officer

Maybe I feel regret
Understand’n his current state
But maybe not

Fk the police

Once hitch'n
I got high with a father
& His teenage son

Haven forgotten
I was in the backseat

The two continued their argue
A tension that gave no repose

The son said he felt awkward

‘ You fucked all my girlfriends
‘ That makes me feel awkward

The father broke free
His bottle'd pressure
That tensed each interaction
With his son

Say'n what need'd to be said

I felt awkward
When they remembered me
.
.
.
When I come roll'n thru
Ain't nobody you ever met like me

Whatever you learn of me
You always remember

The settled hazel gaze
That irritatite'n smirk

Apparel innately agressive
Beard Un-tame’d & Wild

At the last gas station before the US Border
Alberta side

Have'n the odd misfortune
To run out of gas
At the only place
That didn't have her flavor

At the exact place
 I ran out of gas
More than a week earlier

The attendant of this
One Pump Station

Remembered me distraught
From the first time
Have'n to settle for non-Premium

Stuck in the middle of pastures
Never seen most of
What was on the TV

Then to see me
A wayward travel’r

Champion of adventure
A symbol of
Something-Now-Lost

Cheerily you asked
‘ When will you be back

' Likely never
I respond
' Where I go I seldom return

I mostly meet strangers
Strangers see me
Most accurate for who I am
