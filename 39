 XXXVIII
Age is something
Ever to be fear'd

But as most things in life
Near the end
 It is at its sweetest

 Prose Wordsmith
Adventurer True Grit
Unix Hacker 1337

All these activities
Mediocre at best
During my youth


Now at the cusp of Age
Those titles I hold true

Thru such pathways
I see hopeful horizons

Every moment as Testament
To Lifestory
.
.
.
To tell her who I love
That such relation is taboo
To those who
Walk in the path of
La Santa Muerte

To H.P. Lovecraft
To William Blake
To me

Life is for the sow'n
To the Reaper
To reap the rewards

Let action & life
Only ever be for
His memory of me

A 1337 life
& A peaceful mind
