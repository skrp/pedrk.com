 LVI
Bayside
Old Town San Juan

Past day
Behind a backalley nook

Find’n three locals
At my smoke spot

‘ Fumen?
I threw the joint handsign

Venture’n approval of locals
To partake in
Criminal activity

A risk
But necessary for me

Their answer
A cautious approval

To extinguish any suspicion
I prompted

‘ Te gustan blunts
Display’n the hobbit

‘ I’ve never seen a blunt
‘ That small

The four of us
Friends for the life
Of the blunt’s haze

Don’t know their names
They don’t know mine

Never meet’n again

Gotta make that impression
To last past this life
.
.
.
Lost is a deep
Feel’n of forsakeness

When your being testifies:

That this place somewhere
Entirely alien
These coordinates blaze’n
A new way back

Then in the
Rich mud of the Jungle
Your imprinted footprint

Or for the fourth time
See’n that tribal face
Carved in the tree
Oddly solitary in the jungle
.
.
.
After need’n a skill
For survival

The keeness is
Dramatically intensified

Fat on the
Fruits of hustle’n
In one place

Eat’n what I want
Drink’n the finest

Thirty years old
Life never been so good

Aged but in
Pristine physique

I would offer it to Him
Sacrifice it all

For the glory
Of the moment

That Death find me
In a dignified state

Destitute of all
But a memorization
Of these songs
.
.
.
