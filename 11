 XI
My 10th Thanksgiving
My sister
[ older by two years ]

Decided today
Would be the day

At the bay Downtown
Lie a building
Dark Still & Gothic

Once a place of Punishment
Now calling to all
Spirit-Seekers & Adventurers
A Testament to their Ways
-

Beauty is beheld as
Sky Sea & City
Sync in dank motions

Thru thin skin
We absorb'd charged energies

Survey’n the monolith
From the catwalk
Inhale'n Corpus Christi
From on high

Salt Street Decay
Man & Machine

Look'n down to the yard
Of the Courthouse
All Fenced & Boarded

A homeless pass'n & understand'n
Our speculation advise'd

' There
He pointed with his ancient finger
' Thru that hole in the fence

' There
He pointed to a
Particular boarded window
' That one is loose


We watched him meld into Downtown
The plan was too solid to deny

The building is large
& We hard to find
_

Damp Dim & Decrepit
All lie under a layer
Of thick Texan dust

Wooden stairs
Wide & intricately-carved
With 20ft holes

Gape to swallow the unwary
To fall to a deep belly of debris

Like teeth
Its spears wait hungrily
¬_

All furniture lay piled
In the center
Of each courtroom

Lump'd as one guilty heap
Lawyer Layman Judge & Jury


The levels went on & on
Maintain’n solidarity in theme

Matter sentenced
To hallowed depths

Matter consecrated
By memories

All conspire'n to rip down
This ancient Gomorrah
In a suicide's release
_

Condemnation kept to the
Fifth Floor
A place of horror

What light breached
thru small windows
Was filtered further by bars
Cold Heartless & Demean'n

Have we the right to
Life & Liberty

Expulsion humane
Against this captivity
Under the hands of Beasts

Each cell an altar
Shrines Idols & Sacrifices
Adorned to encapsulate the

Infinite & Individual
Violence of the past

Victims returned on mecca
In Reconciliation

Form'n embodiments
From their suffer'n & bondage

Eject'd & Confined
Back to this temporal limbo

Birth'd & Abort’d
At this temporal junction

Complete'n a cycle
 In precious ritual

One cell I remember
A doll bound

Hand & Foot
Stuck & Cut

Graffiti'd with mutilations

Then
My sister grasped my arm
Point'n thru the bars

Deep in the distance
At a large form
Swift & Search’n

' Run
She yelled

We found the stairs
Down & down
In desperate leaps

Unable to distinguish the levels
Pray'n no basement would entrap us

We emerged
Out of that building

Yet on the other side
From where we had entered

Tho young
We were both veterans
To this stage
.
