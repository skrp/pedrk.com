Thumb like a sifter
Filter'n the masses

Patient for those
Kindred to me

A lineage of adventurers

Upon the Newfoundland 
Windswept barrens

Exhausted from the long haul
Erroded like the coast

Each pass'n car
Beats me by bits

Like the waves
Against the rocky bay

A large block of cheese
& Half bagel in my hand

Dried meat
& Half bagel
In my mouth

Stand'n up
Thumb out

I seen your car rise
On the dreary horizon

Hope is all one really needs
After long hiatus & failure

One ride can propel you 
Forward to the finish

A laborer
In the oil fields
Of Alberta

Have'n hitched in your day
Bored this day recover'n
From carpul tunnel surgery

Your wife take'n care
Of the elderly man

Now parapalegic
From collide’n with a moose

On his way home 
From babysitting your boy

I appreciate the ride 
To Crab River

But I treasure
The powwow we shared

Map out

By logistics
I could make
Gros Morne that day

By bus
On boat

Walk'n long
Hitch'n far

Up to the bogs of Gros Morne
End'n the day hammock up

Multiple times

Never remember

This over others different

Deep-seated dream
Sits cast the desire to
Live off the land

In the Selway Wildreness
Grouse critter like vermin

In good position
Starve'n
I took aim & fired

The bird burst
Like a balloon of feathers

Instead of continue'n ahead
It juke'd backwards alive
Down the ravine

I unsheathed the knife
Laid down the rifle 

& Chased it into the bramble
Until enraged & ashamed 

I was forced to concede defeat
Outsmarted by a Grouse

Also seriously injured
From sprung knee

Failure is the pain
To accept

What you dreamt
Wasn't suited for you

Free of our system of captivity

Delight in ones life

Predetermined since before

Always has a wild

Bottles for beer

You know the places
To take liberty

Before the Overpass
Over a small river

A guy on a skateboard
Staggered by

Obedient to my rule no.1
I asked him a question

In reality only care’n
For conversation

‘ I’m with a group
‘ Come check it out

He led me curiously
To the local homeless shelter

Definitely not a place
To take liberty

All outside
Late at night

Managed to get
$10 worth of weed

Unfortunately that meant
Get’n change from a $20

The recipe
For night long paranoia

The homeless tag’d along
Want’n to go hitch’n with me

Always happy for company
Tho never off my guard

We went to the forests

I warned him

When wood is wet

He taught me
How to keep that fire going

Finally arrive’n

Where Bob Marley lived

Concrete square rooms

Bare walls on 5 sides
Continue’n in rows

The deepest pits

Our serious predicament

Now understand’n 
Why other taxi did not take us

Due to the failures of culture
Which foolishly squanders
Where it is needed the least

Bites with a bitterness

That the experienced
Sips as a welcome soothe

Underneath trash & waste

To the Reaper the reward
If any to be had

Often for suspension

He had no friends

To be enlisted

Mountain summits
Barren to provide beauty

When all proximity
Out of focus
Against a panorama

To see vast scapes
Past horizons of the eye

& Not comprehend
How far you gone

To gaze vast scapes
Ahead of the infinite

& Not comprehend
Where you go
_

The end of day
When the Earth
Uncovers the truth

Back to the blind'n blaze
Of self-centeredness 

There a cold hope
In distant actors

Upon time-swept tops
Look'n up

Blessed by westwinds

Rest'n assured
That someone in the Uni
Knows what-the-fk
This all about

To bind the Universe
With sacrament of oneself
 
Rite of physics 
In low level powers
 
Encapsulate'n the energy
Of oneself in record   

To faith in fate
& Settle in the mud

& Preserve yourself
Past an ungrateful era  

To a latter day
Then to be glorified

In all the ecstasy
Of an explorer's discovery

& Then in revelries
Be treasured as deserved 
_

To preserve experience
As fossil record

One must live life
 Worth the effort

To be preserved

One must write
In a manner worth read'n

  Songs encapsulations
Emotions of experience

 These tales
Simple anti-charismatic slurs

Drunk
With adoration of oneself

The rare windows
Of Peace

At the twilight when 
The age of man
Is to be refreshed again

Tides of innocent blood
Purchase atonement
For sins of fathers
 
To birth anew
A sweet age of humanity

Until it grows 
Old & Warped

And the Age of War 
Again ensues retribution

Oneself to be convicted

Boy & his dog
At 19

Day bushwack'n
Foothill to ridge

At the end of day
A choice

Take the known path
Back in the boring fashion

Or go down the backside
Thru an immaculate valley

To come out around 
The otherside of the mountain

In more of a tumble
Than a run

We made our way
Summer at its glory

All rested from the heat
Of the busy day

Desert barren foothills
To Snow thick ridges

To the summit of scapes

Thru the magic of
Valley portals

Beams of wane'n sun
With open arms welcomed

I made my way merrily
A definite conquerer of the mountains

Bleed'n from the thickets
Unquestionably defeated

After twenty minutes
After open valley ended

Conquerer of mountain
Bitch of bushes

I nearly cried
( I did cry)

In total breakdown
Have'n to bushwack

Straight back up the mountain
& Then back down the otherside

Thru small thickets
Dog shake'n all the way

He didn't move

That lesson

Never did
Learn it tho

Pass'n only two rolls

Thru the city

One of the blunts 
Cautiously

' Cuanto?

I handed him
2 Loose dollars

Ready to pay ten
For the
Fresh Caribbean Roll

Twenty minutes
To arrive

The driver's direction
In vision from where he left us

But this transportation terminal
A valuable hub

The hustler
Think'n he outwit me
To tag'n along to where
He also wanted to go

So to lesson
I left him as soon
As he broke away
To greet another

To summit onto the bus
Him completely ditched

I pressured the driver
To break my $10

I let the hustler marinate a while
To be open to
The lesson he was about to learn

' Ven
I called him over

We slapped hands goodbye
Pass'n that way
A folded $5

To prove to him
By universal fashions

Of gratitude
With a day's wage

We two
Of the same stock

His interpretation
Of our situation entirely inverse
 
We parted
Him dazed by the final jab

In the decisive Oneshot
Of a master

In every Jurisdiction in the State

I filed an internal investigation
Troll'd them before the hearing

Caught the dickhead cop
In a lie against his testimony
He seen me jump over the rail

I proved that rail
Had walkway thru it

Testified that I wrestled them 
For 30 seconds

The other cop 
Said it was under 10 seconds

Then I caught 
The Judge sleep'n 
During my testimony

I filed an Appeal
& Another Internal Investigation

Expose'n the cops
Lies I fought them

Months later 
I saw the cop
In a pitiful circumstance

Months later
I discovered Murray Court
Used a judicial loophole

They sent the appeals court
Bogus info & I was never summoned

I gave Murray Court
A copy of my proof

The manager denied claim
To the error
' Nothing we can do

The next year
A different worker
Claimed the error
On their part

 Claimed it unprecedented
& Filed a warrant
For my arrest

I'll never present myself

Dazed

Prosecutors 
Have true power

He was a reasonably guy

For a $200
To settle this all

I told him
I'd have to think about it

When my case was near
To be heard

He asked if I accepted
I decided against offer

His jaw drop'd
He regained himself
Put me last
After everyone left

The American Dream

To stand strong
Against tyrants

No matter how
Little they be

I disdain
Judges most of all

I read the woes of Moses

Tortured by scwabbles
That never cease

Days full of lies

Of self preservation

Life as referee
Of people locked
By the scum of their feud

Appointed to govern
When man releases
Their inner beast

You swore to this
Muthrfkr so own up

No one force you here
Keep your oath

Your daily annoyance
Has long reach'n consequences
To those you sworn

No names needed
When hate to them all

Wish'n the treasure
Of a four letter curse
To which curse an entire kind

That branch of Government
With the most trust

The branch of Government
That corrupted the others

With the darkness
Of a betrayed lover

Will never clean
The greasy slime
Without itself
Become'n the same

Visit'n as church people

Pour this out
In memory of
Mentors
That made me me

RSH
Fourth of July 2014

The Bob Marshall
A fabled wilderness
Of North America

Its pitched ridgeline bar'n
Me & my motorcycle machine

I should have known
The Forest Service
Would be closed

Highway 83
Near Swan Lake Montana

No where else to go
But a deep country gas station
Have'n left Helena on a whim
The epitome of out-of-place

I knew of no trail
Nor place where to start

An elderly trapper
Came up to me
Disposable coffee cup
Blue Velvet cap

Pich'n upon my sight
Some welcome advice

' Follow me to the back
Inside the backrooms

Great maps
Sprawled about
' There is only one trail
' In 60 miles
' That can put you past the ridge

He would do me a solid
& Host the motorcycle on his property
_
This cabin
Built by his own hands

On a Lumberman's plot
In the woods

The trailhead not many miles from the plot
I draped the tarp over the motorcycle
.
.
.
The Bob Marshall
A cold heartless bitch

Descending into her
Over much snow

The trail not yet used
No more than once or twice this year

I went cautiously over
An iceberg of snow
At a critical pitch

I tied my skank to a tree
As a flag for the crux to the pass 
.
.
.
Perpendicular perched
A glacial pond

That drew
Itself to me

As a Siren
Sing'n her song

Blaze'n from main trail
To a grove of every type of water flow
.
.
.
The cold cultivate'n
A high altitude enchantment

Dimension
Breached, melded & interweaved

Once I was sure of
Two men pleasantly talking on canoe

If ever I experienced ghosts
It was then

In the morn
I knew

Such a site impossible
This place secluded
As secluded can be
.
.
.
Pathfinding in springtime
Is a real muthrfkr

Waterways blaze'n paths
Instead of the logical
Thruway of the animal
_

I returned a day early
The iceberg I crossed

Near the skank-flag
Now entirely gone

 Avalanched
All down
.
.
.
Back
On the other ridge side

I'd sworn I seen a grizzly cub
Lost I ran on a trail

Know'n there was not
Any other option

At least none I could
Plainly see
.
.
.
Down a ridgeside
Victim of great fires

I could not help
But be astonished

Not one of my
Previous tracks left
Tho there were
Recent hoof prints
.
.
.
Off the foothills

The old man told me a path
Upon which I must take to return

The path
A short cut
Chained off & restrict'n traffic
As much as one could
Out in the woods

I became greatly suspicious
Only hoof prints recently imprinted
.
.
.
To the trees I kept
Away from the open passages

In the distance I saw something
But my eyes are not for farsee'n

The blur of a man
As if one take'n careful aim
Near by a white donkey
_

That old trapper
Had a white donkey

Line of sight that far
On wood paths is lost easily

A trap carefully crafted
Mayhap ruined by
My day early return

I kept near the trees
MK-MOD
Now out defensively

If it was him
Why had he not greet me?
.
.
.
The last of the path
He drew on the map
Oddly like a loop
As indirect as can be

I got to the cabin at Dusk
& Remembered my laptop 'safety inside'

The cabin was built in that
Simple small fashion

An awkward 20min
Fore the old man
Came to the door

In a pant as if he'd run
Just now for dear life
Custom required him to
Invite me inside
To retrieve my belongings

I was careful to be concealed
But he may have seen me
With knife pulled back in the woods
It all
Only a misunderstanding
.
.
.
The .22 & scope pistol
One he favorited on his hunts

Taken from its spot
From where he previously left it

Of bad eyesight
& Irratic judgement

I do not let myself
Convict to be sure of anything
.
.
.
To past midnight
Us across each other

In that lone cabin
Round wooden table

His .40 lay
On table in front of him
In the open
 A manner of long-lost-respectancy

At dusk he had offered his couch
I thanked the offer

As an adept of Nessmuk
I craved the knowledge of this
Montana mountain man

Who had long lived
Off bushcraft

Techniques that will
Likely die with him

Unless I makes means
To extract them
& Record down for future use
.
.
.
Risk as it was
We had conversation

Not know'n him
Victim or villian

This conservative man
Once leader of a group of trappers

I looked up to this man
In unchecked respect

He is who
I've always wanted to become
.
.
.
Casually
I told him I'd been
In contact thru messages
With my sister Megan

I scheme'nly
Kept the nature of the message
From him

Unsettled deeply
When he inquired

If my phone
Had GPS

I feigned a gesture of
Sneak'n an item out of my bag
& Into my pocket
Put'n him offset from the gesture
I told him I had to leave
& Then left
_

I yearned to be
His bushcraft apprentice

But I respect
The neverending signs of suspicousity

These situations
Make me question
Deeply my sanity
.
.
.
 VXXVI
Sanity
Found somewhere else
Than to be with me

A long time ago

At the junction
The set the stage
To the Appalachian Trail

Society in necessity
Sets a sanity standard

Well enough
For me to expose it
& Subsequent dispose it

house taxes & all other shit
wife cat & all other loiters

This damn archive
All the energy 
Laid in what 
Future requires of it

 Is there any other
Stoner hacker 

With the dedication
To store independent knowledge
Things
I hate things

Give me nothing
But what 
Can fit in my pack

A bed
Some shelter
Stale food
A weapon

& I'll produce
Something 
That will never be forgot

Intangible in that
Ghastly way
That heeds no physics

In that perpetual motion
Of the anchorless

To proceed forward
Into the future
 _

Don Quijote 
No insane

Desperate
At end of days

To savor sweet moments
His poets elude

Immagination
Never discrete from reality

Tho the meat of it
Experienced as in songs

To feel defiance
Against the immutable

From belief
Understand mechanics
.
.
.
Those reckless
Advanced in age

60+
White-haired

Heroes
Billy to the youth

Future
Under such terms

A blank white page
As if hair
Opens an expanse
To handle whatever
.

I don't give a fk

Cause aint no where
Been a place

I couldn't juke out of

Take my body
Free my mind

Take my mind
free my body

What you got on me
Beside several counts
To arrest me by

You, them & fk else
Don't got hold of me

At the local dive
Or out on the streets

Aint no one
You ever meet

That as hard
As me

punk'n cops
us packs on motorcycles
or as myself
go'n too fast
cops just give up

To tax land
Is to own land

Leave all else
In lease

Govts of the world
Take away

Ancestral lineage
In that fashion

 LVXXV
Up the Uintas
Thru deer trail

Travelers on
The same path

We meet
Them with friends

I move them along
Talk'n with them
_

Over & above
After the winter spring

Lay a lofty plane
Mossy green cushion

Laid out evenly 
A slope of the valleys

Best view
_

I know what
Others look like

Upon my site
Wish'n I were'nt there

My threaten'n presence
Rude 

The town of deer
Or a town of people

They both give
The  same expression
_

I continued till
Elune bore down

Up the crest
Of the hills of the summit

I abandoned deer trail
 & Blazed my way
 _

Blunt'd & Completely lost
I saw a light

I followed it
I went to where it was

What is close
In the mtns

May be near
Impossible to reach

A deep gorge
Between it & I

Was there a path across

Trees & balds
Likely places for traffic

Ancient paths
Which the snow betrayed

Overgrown & unused
Up & Down

Sometimes 
Back around

Crux of where
The gorgesides meet

A rocky cliff
That looked like
The summer's waterfall

I managed to cross
That high & severely sloped

Mostly wet
For 100 yards

The cliff had a way
To climb up

Finally arrived
Only the other side

The way up looked dry
Tho it was soaked slick

If I slip'd once
I'd unavoidably

Keep on
For as long I had life in me

Curiously
I found another path

Blindly forward
Stay'n low under the cliff
_

To turn back
I always a good option
 more dangerous
 LXXVI - SameDayFresh
Gravity  & Time
Intricately weaved

Physical perspective 
In tune with the two

Perspective(Physical) = Time(Gravity)

My fat black cat
Has a physical perspective
Much quicker than my own

This  law is her
Justification
To look at me
As if I am stupid
_

I woke
From nyquil tranquility

The night prior
Full of horror

As if its state
Kept me there

Infinitely longer
A quantum world

& It

Bearing no mass
Void of Physical Perspective

An experience
At times too great

As if 
The blackness of sleep
A mercy to most

We all joined
At Quantum Junctions
_

3Chop came over
An hour later

Used her membership
To get my ticket out

Over the Oceans
To Eastern Europe

Fascism
Doesn't head in politicians
It heads
In its internal force

Now with fantastic
Fascist Powers

Their cyber net
Cast over all

I reach to

En route
To El Yunque

At a bar

Across the Police Station
Where the taxi left me

I needed a lighter

A drunk guy
Turned to me

' You are going
' To the jungle

' Just to check it out
I replied

He responded
'As soon as you asked
' For a lighter I knew
' I work there
' You can't stay there
' Over night its illegal

I was annoyed
The taxi driver
Just harang'd me about that
_

A couple hours pass
Late up the jungle road

Late of night
Many fears remembered

Unpassable marshes

Mud in that charateristic
Rich Ocre Murk

Night still & bright

A white car
Pulled up honk'n

Oh shit
The Rangers

It was the guy
From the bar

' Want a ride

He & his wife
Drove me the 10 miles up

Take'n 20 miles out of his way
To drop me off

Strangers
Always surprise me
.

 LXXX
Hour
& A half long classes

Were real muthrfkrs
Never could be still
Very long

Stevo
Commonly known as
Crackhead Stevo

A bad choice
To go to in need

Tomorrow Friday
4 Term tests

He must have been
The only friend at hand

Cause he promised me
Tomorrow he would get me
Some herbal pills
To help me focus

 All I needed
Was the Red Bull

8:50am 
At our normal spot

Uncontested under the tree
In the parking lot

Facing away
From school

I downed the 2 pills
With the Red Bull

' I couldn't find
' Those herbal pills
He admitted

' What did you give me?
 I didn't know
If I should be alarmed

' I don't know
He replied calmly

Anthony came in
For the save

' Here take these
' Two adderral
' They will definitely 
' Make you focus

Mid test
I twerk the fk out

Never been high before
Hit me like a truck

All my teachers
Knew I was blitzed
Out of my mind
They all dealt with me
In a kind understanding
.
.

I researched pathways on Google Maps
Of one Hong Kong Island

Nighttime on the pathway
I saw lights
Swift & Search'n
 Miles off
At the other end
Of this ocean cove
I assumed it a Lighthouse

At the other end
Of the ocean cove
I found no lighthouse

Only a sign in
Cantonese & English
But I care naught for adversements

Up the only path
Up the hill to a village
Which cultivated the slopes
Of this Mountain Ravine

There near the summit
Lay a house
Large Wooden & Old

Odd to see a non-vacant house
Look Dead & Still

Farm paths led different places
I stayed on the path
That led to the mountain pass

The search’n lights I'd seen
From the other end
Of the ocean cove
Were now focused
On something at the mountain pass
The lights became many

The action of the beams disturbed me
By the nature of its frantic movements
To the extent I decided to retreat

Failed & deeply distraught
I knew this the only path

I headed back
There repass'n the sign
I stopped to read it

 ‘ If you cross this border
‘ You trespass
‘ Into a private village
‘ We will assume you are a thief
‘ And treat you accordingly

DefCon 23
Dropped off in Las Vegas
Alone with no plan at night

Under 20 minutes
I sat hold'n a
Black dealer’s
Gold chain

Collateral
 As he went
To get my weed
_

Las Vegas lights are trippy
When you are high

Smoke'n a joint
You roll'd out back

The lights to my back
Turned out to be
Not the cops

But that fright had startled me
My smartphone
Fell & shattered

Destroy'n any way to contact
Those who had my room

From Wed morning at 7am
Till Saturday afternoon at 3pm
 I went without sleep
_

Las Vegas

The only city
Where the night is life

& The day
Only a drunken stumble home
.

.
My weapons
Are of the Elite Grade

None more fine in the grade
Of practicality
& Brotherly protection

1100mi into the Appalachians
Christina would join me

For one month
Of 400mi of mountain

Downtown Harrisberg Penn
At a military surplus

As an Eagle Scout
It is a surprise
To bled when testing a blade

I decided to return
To purchase what kiss'd me

Tho there was no money to spare
Her lipstick served
Too strong a memory

The Spax SP-18
Cost a dear $50

Aged
Fermented in Failure

These songs resonate from
A salted soul

Have'n only succeeded
By the statistical need

For all functions
To have outliers

Turn'n to the written word
To salvage the debris

Of visions strewn asunder
Where once epic schemes bloomed

In all the glory
Of imaginations
_

Tho pained evermore
Still peace reins

Where there are no
Unanswered questions

Live'n Fast
To Die Young
Since Childhood

Body cruch’d to the longboard

Friday Night
Sanctified of Mary

Coffee run'n its course

Consoles Alt'd
Scroll'n by

Man pages print'n & mark'd
To issue way

When the fabric of mind
Beg's Mercy & Repose

But repose it will not have
For that is the secret
To this Sanctification

Till Stress
Pressure'n Full-Throttle

Only fertile offer'n
Mary savors sweetly

Upon such grounds
Great Gifts Bestow’d

Purified by insight
On extra-natural planes

Upon that Transcendental
To Quest for questions

 XXXXV
I have gathered firewood
All night with a few people

The latest was when I went to Ottawa
For the World Unix Conference BSDCan

Headed to camp in the woods
For the night

I met a homeless
My age
By the homeless shelter

After buy'n weed
He decided to come
Hang out with me
Hope'n to hitch out with me

I warned him it might get cold
But he was Canadian

I taught him how to make fire from a candle
From wet wood

He taught me how to keep a fire going
Until 4am constantly gather'n wood

I gave him $20 to go get more weed
To meet later at McDonalds

Mayhap it was the freeze of that night
Covered in my second layer clothes
He suffered the cold Canadian June night

Or mayhap he couldn't resist
Spend'n that $20

Either way
I never saw him again
I'd get to Newfoundland alone
.

If the govt is mad at me
Well I accept the consequences
Of live'n a lawless life
 It is a part of me
I wish never taken away
Tho I may at times take liberty
In the freedom of my wishes
Tho I strive hard
To bless others with the like
 shout out
To my
Masters of Writ
To whom I homage

Dorothea Brande
All stern & inspire'n

William Zinsser
Of cold clarity

Stephen King
Whisper'n dark secrets
Of the living

Walk Whitman
Flow'n the melodies of underground springs

William Blake
A kindred spirit to whom I bow

Mayhap the homogenous belief
Of mankind hold true

That one day we converse
As equals who sacrificed all
To the same god
.
.
.
The Virtue of Narcissism
Ungrasped by the masses

Who could never introvertly
Confirm
Their life as most precious
Confirm
Themselves blessed
By the interested hand of gods

Who need no justification
For received adoration

Prideful gaze
Regardless of mirrors

Confident
To take sure steps forward

Grateful of the past
But mostly
Excited for this new day
.

Who am I
Which revels in such self
