 LVIII
I have followed
The White Rabbit

To its hovel
High on the hill

Into its narrow
Caverns of dark

Where the dank
Of underground thrives

Not much is left
Now the hilltop is settled

Earth of sacred nature
Bulldozed by Residentials

Years there alone
As when I was a teen

I believed my lack of skill
Kept me lonely with no krew

Now 1337 I see
None but scrubs crawl'n free

Where have all
The White Rabbits Gone

Now past 100T
Experience in scrape'n
Via protocols

Methodized by

7 Million+ Deduped data
700+ Data encodings

50T+ Seed
& I its curator

From my daily efforts
I lay brick by brick

A great range
Of personality
Encapsulated by binary
