The Appalachian Trail
My great trial

Like the natives
Of whose blood I share

In ritual I pass thru
Great ordeal
To emerge a man

To the North
From sunrise to the right
Till it set at the left

Each step
A new step

A simple life
With a peaceful mind

To hike an unbroken
Pathway of mountain

From Georgia
2000mi
To Maine

There to seek
The ominous mountain

Natives named in reverence
Katahdin

In Buenos Aires
I drop'd an online class
This recalled all financial aide

The Dean declined
My offer to pay half
Of the five figure sum
To continue study'n
On payments

At the University of Utah
I researched an escape path

Up into Canada
Far from here
v
v
v
The Internet
In its typical fashion
Redirected me

Into an article on
The Appalachian Trail

Which I had thought
Was in South America

The distraction soon
Seen as providence

Within the hour
I had a flight to Atlanta
To arrive the next day
v
v
v
Downtown Atlanta 5am
Crackheads scurry

In final desperate efforts
To hustle up
Whatever makes their tick purr

Twisted figures
Kept to the shadows
There they jitter spastically

12hrs of roam
Till I arrived
At my CouchSurf host
Jaina from Germany

Cities
Are the loneliest places
v
v
v
In the morn
I went to search for gear
To supplement my current set
From Urban Backpack'n

A 13mi trek to
Sports Authority

By word of mouth

To make mistakes
Cheaply
v
v
v
At Pidemont Park
I eazily dozed off

A successful test of the
Thermarest Z Pad
_

A middle-aged woman
Sat swing'n

Only despair
& 2 Overstuffed suitcases

I saw her in me
But I couldn't see
Me in her

I had the momentum
Of one last
All-In

Parks
Are my favorite places
v
v
v
A couple in their 50s
Both teachers in Cummings
Invited me to stay with them

Wayne offered to pick me up
After a Couchsurfing event

We left in a rush because
He had business
To take care of

I told him
' That's fine
' Good thing I brought
' My Ereader

In that awkward way
Of tell'n your host
Not to feel burdened

Wayne only continued
' Have you ever seen someone
' That owes you money

Wayne asked more to himself
His pitch began to rise
In excitement

' You should have seen her face
' When she recognized me

Wayne cranked the music
Awake in his own world
We raced towards Downtown
v
v
v
On my long trek
To Sports Authority

I had passed the run-down
Strip club

We now pulled into

I had wondered what went on
In such a shit hole

Odd how life
Answers questions

' Hold this
Wayne handed me a pamphlet
Of some schmuck
Running for Sheriff

' Make sure she sees it
' She will get the picture
V
V
V
5pm on a weekday
My first strip club experience

Blinded by darkness
We entered into the corridor

A crack-whore
Immediately approached us

' Hey handsome
She jeers at Wayne
' I need a real man
' To get me off
She says look'n at me

Bashed by a crack-whore
Interesting

' I'm looking for Kristi
Wayne tells her
' She is working tonight
' Right?

' Oh she just left
The whore said smartly

Signal'n thru some
pre-planned method

Likely common
In this business

Wayne left me there
To rage in the restroom

His carefully crafted scheme
Thwarted
By a half-conscious whore

She turned to me
' No hard feelings, Right?
V
V
V
' This is just between us
' Couchsurfers

Wayne informs me
On the ride home

Their home was classy

I suffered the
Social sit down with his wife

I avoided them
As much as possible

I left their home
& A thank-you note

To continue my journey

Still a far distance
From the Appalachian Trailhead

My first time
Hitchike'n in the States

Most things in life
Can be accomplished
Just by try'n
_

I helped a guy roll his motorcycle
Up to the gas station

Obviously distraught
When he admitted
' I don't have any money
' To give you

Most people my entire life
Have assumed me a homeless
Or a hooker
V
V
v
40min later a woman
In a large red truck
Pulled aside

' You don't look dangerous
She said out the window

Her downs-syndrome daughter disagreed
She kept call'n me
' Bad man

In her day she had hitch'd
These where her rules:

1 - Never get into a car with more than one person
2 - Never wear a seat belt
3 - Keep the door unlocked

She also told me
To ditch my unrefrigerated balone
If I ate it I would be poisoned

Our paths overlaid
For the first half

I thanked her
Then went on my way
v
v
v
Ben picked me up
On his way to the ranch

He decided to take me
All the way to the trailhead
Amicola

I'd never heard of Amicola
But he was sure
& Didn't pay attention to my suspicion

Maybe it was the rain
That convinced him
To be the only one
After hours
To pull up aside

But some people
Will pick you up
Regardless
V
V
v
I mostly
Meet strangers

The bond of a strangers
Has only ever been of
Unbroken trust
v
v
v
Amicola Visitors Center

I signed in
Pack weight of 58lb

They gave me my only map
A paper route to Springer

Up that intense climb of stairs
A guy hike'n with his wife advised

' You only need one shirt
' & One sweater
V
V
v
After 3mi
Time to camp

I had arrived to the trail
After a long journey

The salesman at
Sports Authority
Wouldn't let me set up
The tent to test it

' I assure you
' The Hiker-Biker II
' It has room for two

Claustrophobic knots
Tied my stomach
As I looked at it

More of a bivy-sack
Than a tent

I would have to hug my pack
In order to fit inside
V
V
v
An Eagle Scout
I could make a fire
With only one match

But this wasn't the South
After 45min
I conceded defeat
_

Paranoid from the lady's advice
I threw all 3 packs of balone

Out in all directions
From my camp

Think'n it best
Not to concentrate the smell
v
V
v
Nothing was left
For me in my past

I threw away all
That I didn't take with me
In my pack
The night
Before my flight

A veteran to depression
I was prepared
With sleeping pills

To escape
The sorrowful night
v
v
v
May 20th
The morn sang

Beautiful & Bright
Lush & Vibrant

A good mood
Was inescapable

The 6mi to the
Summit of Springer
Full of heal'n
V
V
V
I had used the paper map for firestarter
The most worn paths were the ones I chose

On Springer
I began build'n a fire

A couple approached me
With 2 Powerbars

I turned them down
' I don't need Powerbars
' I can get this started
But they insisted

45min later
I was eat'n Powerbars

In Texas
A fire past a certain point
Is a healthy heart

Not so much so here
I been past that point
Numerous times
V
V
V
Two old men around a fire
Allowed me to boil eggs

I boiled the dozen
Future fire unlikely

One old man
Had hiked the trail
Twenty years ago
To the day

An adventure he started
The day after he retired

The first thru hiker
I met

His advice
Ditch all the pots
Cook from a cup
& Only sleep in shelters
v
v
v
At the end of the day
I found a shack
With someone in it

Rambo II
Christened After Rambo

The original
A black guy with a bow
Play'n around
Nearly hit someone in their tent
With an arrow

Needless to say
Rambo had to leave the trail

Rambo II begged him
For his food supplies
& Named himself Rambo II
In gratitude

Now he sat patch'n his feet
With duct tape
V
V
V
Like me he had a slingshot
Like me he had to hitch in

Unlike me
Rambo II slept in bushes

He explained
This building was a shelter

Many of which
Were scattered the entire trail

I gave him some of my ammunition
He gave me cat can
& Cube-fuel
To use as a stove

I don't think Rambo II
Ever left that shelter
v
v
v
In the morn I met
Orange & Juice

A gay couple that came out
To rough it

Speakers strapped to their pack
60lbs+ each
Short Tights & Solar Panel

They asked to borrow a lighter
I gave them one

I couldn't
Make use of it

In gratitude
They offered powwow
_

Did they know of Nessmuk
One of the saviors
Of Bushcraft

Techniques nearly lost
Of how to settle in the woods

Forced by sexual preference
To often trample in the woods
V
V
v
I'd not been high
For some time

I had been
In Argentina

Then I had been
Extremely depressed

For some time
For many reasons

Tho the morn before
Assured me with confidence

It was time to have a
Happy High
v
v
v
Baptized in Smoke
Affiliate'n me with

The Order of Adventurers

An Order
I desperately craved
Since childhood

Which I sought always
Tho never found

Yearn'n the wilderness
Yearn'n the roam

Yearn'n a path
With no return

Enjoy the present
The future is an
Unstable promise

Torrential rains
Ran me out my tent

To a table
Under cover of the shelter

My tent was flooded
In inches

Hawk Mtn Shelter occupied:

Bathsalts

Which play no parts in this story

Of all
I was the only one
Travel'n alone

v
v
Roadwarrior

At over 6ft tall
His eyes gave a confident
Gleam of domination

He had to finish
By a certain date
Every day of the hike was planned
v
v
v
As I copied key mileage
From Roadwarrior's books

I asked
' What does the word Blazes mean
' In this book

' Those White Blazes you been following
' Marked on the trees
Someone said clearly incredulous

I'd seen marks
Blue White & Orange

' Amicola is an
' Approach trail
' That's why it was blue
' Only the Appalachian Trail
' Is White Blazed
Dead Horse Beard
Clarified

Everyone looked at me
Like I was a
Loon or a Liar
v
v
v
Orange & Juice
Bickered nonstop

One asked if I also believed
That the other was being
Too Anti-social
& Should apologize
For the embarrassment
It had caused everyone

I felt grateful
To be alone
v
v
v
Army Rangers were up
All night train'n
Throw'n live grenades

Close enough for me
To be worried

Makes us even

Thru the day
I lost some things

Mayhap you come across

A few blue pans
Or 4lbs of
Lentils & Beans
v
v
v
Only 10mi in
At a beautiful clear'n

Lay a shelter
With a clear spring

DHB & Bathsalts
Already settled

They asked me
To stay

It would be rude
To refuse

I melted in my water bottle
Try'n to make them Hot Chocolate

I fell asleep after the fire

Food that can be eaten
Cold or Cooked

Is best to carry
In the woods

The balance of flavor
Must also be maintain'd

Too savory
It will be eaten too quickly

Too wholesome
You will go malnutritioned
_

Instant Oatmeal
The perfect trailfood

Light Compact
Sugary Nutritional

It can be cooked
Without fire
3hr in a water bottle

It can warm you in the morn
To wake you to a new day

It can be eaten raw
In intensive bursts
Needed to carry the day

v
v
I met a day hiker

He wanted to throw a wrench
Into the mechanics
That were drive'n him
Downward

There was no evidence
Of this on his face
As he offered powwow

Appalachian Heal'n
Had cast its smile

v
v
Eat'n lunch
With Bathsalts & DHB

I discovered on their map

Only Blood Mtn lay between
Me & my first resupply

The promise of pizza
Pass'd me over that mtn
Like it only a small hill
v
v
v
Tales had been told
Since I first arrived in Atlanta

About this Pizza

Found at the first stop
They charge hardly anything

Anything you want
Piled on top
Baked hot in the oven
Specific to your order

I caught the store workers
As they tried close'n early

' Where do I order pizza

He pointed back behind the rack
Of candy bars & beef jerky

I looked back confused

' Its in the top door
( Obviously )

The fabled pizza
Was a $2 Walmart Pizza
Quadruple priced
v
v
v
Roadwarrior looked at me with
What I could only perceive
As unpleasantness

He jumped on Jonathan
For keep'n his pace slow
V
V
v
I decided to help support this hostel
Reek'n of piss & dust

It made its living
Only for this trail

How rare to do that
In the mountains
_

That night was magical
That will forever glow

Roadwarrior & Jonathan
Bathsalts & DBH
& Some others

All of us rest'n
After the first days of adventure
V
V
V
Bathsalts cut off his straps
To save weight

He used only
Space blankets for warmth
His sandals tore into him

I christened him
Bathsalts

He would douse himself in
Talcum Powder Regularly

That night he advised me
To ditch my
Electronic shaver
To man beard it

Leave'n Neels Gap
My pack weight: 24lbs
v
v
v
Before I left
I asked the workers
For advice

They troll'd me

' I started way
' Earlier than you
' & I barely made it
' You won't make it

He was the first
To put me on that
Ruthless pace
Countless would echo

Drive'n me
Restlessly forward
v
v
v
The predatory behavior
Of outfitters is despicable

Convince'n that without 'right' gear
You wouldn't be able to hike

They rather see you spend
Your money there
Or go home defeated
v
v
v
v
As I walked out of the gap
I came upon a weary traveler

The no-longer-white shirt
Bore testament to his tales

' Came up here from
' The Florida Trail

' There was always too much water
' Or not enough

' I once had to filter water
' From a Rest Stop toilet

We sat upon the ridge
To cold lunch

' Within a week of live'n in Florida
' I went into pills
' It's bad there

' Started shoot'n pills
' Within a week

' I lost my job
' As a data analyst
' Six months later

' I'm out here to
' Redefine myself

The only Veteran Stealth Camper
I ever met
v
v
v
Get'n to the pass
That would get me to a Walmart

Passed me
Like a powerful draft

A day hiker offer'd
To drive me to town

He have'n just arrived
About to embark
On this beautiful morn

Who would I be
If I took that hour
From a sap

That had to go back
After he enters
V
V
V
An elderly man picked me up
As I walk'd

Down the pass
Thumb out

His wife & he
Drove to Alaska every year

Tho not since
She been gone

Children nor Grandchildren
Willing to accompany him

He let out
His lonely tale

Strangers are sometimes
The safest confidants
V
V
V
Often I had been that Stranger
Confident in stride

Those in moments of weakness
See this & bear their sadness upon me

Dark tales
In horrific scenes

Help'n them bear burdens
That can never be forgotten

Whether subject to the
Horrors of poverty in Mexico
Or here in the States
v
v
v
Everyone look'd at me
With disbelief

I stuffed
$100 worth of $3 goods
Into my small pack
On a bench at Walmart

I had to walk 2mi
Before a truck
Went into the parking lot
Enthusiastically honk'n

The omnipresent
Encouragement of locals

Around where the
Appalachian bears it course

Is
Phenomenal & Unparalleled
v
v
v
At the summit of
Tray Mtn

The sun wane'n
At 5pm

A group in kilts
Informed me

I missed a note
Bathsalts & DHB wrote

Despite my full pack
I made the 13mi
Still to go

Friendship is rare
I live a lonely life
v
v
v
Tomorrow
I would reach North Carolina
Nothing could change that fact
v
v
v
At every resupply
It is because

At the lowest gap in the range
A road can run thru

Make'n a quick entry to resupply
But the climb out
When you are overstuffed
Is a real muthrfkr

The past days had been
Many of those gaps

Descend'n down
' As Knob
I felt the pain

I could only crawl
Step by step
The next miles
To the water source
v
v
v
It was a measly water source
But I managed to do all my wash'n

A skill I perfected
2 years in Mexico

The Dark Tower

From non-fictional adventure

Ankle massaged

v
v
Wiggles dance'd
Down the mountain

She come up to my tent
On the last rays of day

To camp with me

Odd to want to camp
With a stranger
In the woods

But I allowed it
v
v
v
Wiggles re-taught me firemake'n
With simplicity

' Find alot of dry crap
' Light it in a loose bunch

' If there is no
' Dry crap to be found
' Use your stash of Birch Bark

' Birch Bark can be lit wet
' Always carry it

She was 22
Thru hiked the year before

' You can always find a way
' To keep on go'n

I explained
' I only plan to get to Maine
' I have no ties to the trail

She smartened me up
' If you can do
' Katahdin in October
' You can do anything

' Always Remember
' Don't ever leave
' Your pack high

We gather'd wood together
Into the night

Forest warped by fire
Into prance'n shadows

Later I discovered
Our meeting
Was not chance

Bathsalts & DHB
Who eventually passed me

Met her & told her
To stay with me

She smoked out a homeless
Because he said
He was a hiker

Consequently
She was freaked out
v
v
v
The night had been
Full of heal'n
As magic moments happen

My ankle was fine
I crossed over into
North Carolina
In the early morn

My first state boundary
Simply a carve'n

Bathsalts & I read together
At a waterfall

I stayed a bit longer

Come'n thru the gap
I discovered
Some of those Memorial Day brats
Threw away the majority of
Two 24-pack of soda
& Reeses candy

There was a bag for trash
Oddly apart from the discarded sodas

Very conveniently placed
Near the Reeses
To discard the wrappers

Life is sometimes
Odd like that

I didn't know if
DHB & Bathsalts
Found this repository

So I hauled up
As many as I could

This wasn't
Go'n to waste

That creep'd out Wiggles

He told me
' Cats taste like tuna

I gave him some food

v
Caught up
To my friends at camp

I told them my amazing find
& Dropped down
All the cokes

DHB was exasperated
But Bathsalts was game

DHB explained
' This was Trail Angel Food
' We should be respectful

He didn't believe
I was ignorant of the
Existence of Trail Angels

The idea that strangers
Leave food out

Which other strangers
Eat naively

Seems ludicrous for anyone with
Preschool street smarts

I laid sodas like
Easter Eggs

Thru the ridge
On my way out in the morn

There are few things spookier
Than the sound of water

When you are alone
In the woods

Water is best drought
From the source
Before the end of day

Before sight
Is replaced by sounds

Before knowledge
Is replaced with assumptions

Plops & Trickles
Drips & Flows

Become vocalized
In overtones of sadness

Remember'n its wild past
Formely held sacred
As a shrine of life

By respectful
Beasts of the forest

Marked 100mi

Still under 5%

Each day
A Derivative of the Infinite

A sine in rhythmn
Orchestrated by the
Calculus of primal Nature

At Cold Springs Shelter
I rummaged as I always did
Look'n for food

In the firepit I found
4 Cliffbars & 6 Nature bars

Customarily

As frugal as myself
That could continue

Tho with my hustle'n
I could always score
Enough to share with others

Dead Horse Beard

Climbed with the
Stubbornness of a Beard
That continues to grow
On a Horse
Dispite it being Dead

Hence DHB was christened

v
v
I nearly stepped on
The first
Rattlesnake I encountered

I killed the beast
With one shot

Its soul-less body
Continued on

My next shot missed
As it crawled
Thru the thicket

To stop dead
Under a branch

I hit it with another shot
Just to be sure

Thus I was christened
3Shot The Rattlesnake Eater

By Trail & Error
I learned to prepare meat

My story follow'd
Ahead of me

As only stories can
For more than 1000mi

6mi to the
Nantahala Outdoor Center

Walk'n from a hot meal
The Hiker Burger

Someone called out
' You hike'n the trail?

Then threw me a
Mountain Dew

Or the new Leki trek'n poles

Not pressed for time

Up that climb North
All dark woods & storm

Thunder & Tree Crash

Storm
In definite torrent

Dark forests
Glazed by water
In nightly glows

Up those
Twisted & Mangled Paths
Only need'n to be
Narrow enough for one

A majestic sky invoked
Super Natural Powers
Upon this ancient mountain top

Have'n long since
Come into intimate
Cohabitiation with

Water treatment

Of arrogance

A childhood trait

Definite goal
In mind

Pack under
20lbs base weight

There was no bridge
To return to my past

All laid in waste

A new future must be forged
If there ever was to be one

Till I reach tomorrow
& Write down what all happened
Whether it be about

The brilliance
Of color
Off a Box Turtle shell
Slowly make'n his way
Down the mountain

Or the greasy slyness
That seeps off the
Black scales
Of a nested snake
In the hollow
Of a tree trunk

With a few passages
From the Bible

3am he climb'd
Into the shelter
Amidst the Cold Front

The kid in
Chuck Taylors
Id seen before NOC

I came upon him later
The next day

He nibble'd on mushrooms
That he had pick'd

He instructed
' If it tastes nutty
' Then you know its edible

' Very Wise
I agreed

He explained
' My mother doesn't like me
' I have no where else to go

I ask'd why he arrived
So late last night

' I hike at night
' I don't even need a light
' I feel the earth
' Under my soles

Truly wise words
From one so young

The Great Smokey Mountains

Expanses of
Clustered Dark Forests
Bramble Berry Thickets

Its moon bright
Wish'n Welcome & Saftey
In wakeful motherly assurance

At a beautiful site
Twix two creeks cross

The rains after midnight
Left me the hard choice

Try sleep'n soak'd

Or continue to the shelter
7mi away
30mi in one day
There to sleep dry

I decided
The only rest would be ahead

As soon as I packed
My headlight flickered

Tight paths
Thru dense wood

Trail only marked
By the light flicker'n

Whenever Elune bore her face
Upon puddles
Left by imprints of trail

Hours in
Misery of rain

Too miserable
To take off my pack
& Stash my tent
Swollen with water
In my arms all night

Hours in the
Eerie deep night fog

Amoung dark ferns
& Celestial canopy

At times crawl'n
At times circl'n

Always just hope'n
To see that geometric shape
Of manmade shelter

Harshly outlined from the scenery

I had no map
Only the promise
Of that one sign
Before my earlier camp

The Weak Haze of Morn
Broke the void of night

Finally a sign bore witness
The next shelter
8mi ahead

In the night
I missed the shelter

I set up the tent
That I in misery carried

Sleep'n dank
As 6am hit

Only to rise
In the late morn
& See 50 yards away

The shelter
I had so hopefully sought

Typical of classic rural Virgina

I knocked upon
The first house

An elderly lady
Lent me her phone
Tho terrified of my presence

I'd met some people
Who like others
Took pictures of me
As I fed upon their treats

In the manner of one
Who is grateful

Always driven to feed
To be sure it is
Preoccupied

They enthusiastically
Offered to host me
When I got to this point

Told me of a pavillion
Where I could stay

She warned

I assured her
A storm is no challenge

When the storm hit
Trees fell like rain

The crash
A boom above thunder

Around one large felled tree
A Day Hiker came round

In his hysteria
He began to follow me

Back round
Up the mountain

I eventually
Had to stop & tell him

' Turn around
' You go'n the wrong way

His car was that way
His home in that direction

Reduced to crawl'n
As dark was upon me

The Clash & Bash
Of tree fall

Palpable
Tremors from the trees

Past the ridge
Upon a perch of rock

An odd beast crouch'd

Not a deer
Not only by form
But also by the way

Focused upon me
Amazed I summit'd
Despite the storm

Head'n Down & Out

In madness of terror
While descend'n around
A fallen tree
Turn'd to follow me
Into the woods

I eventually had to stop
& Assure the man that

He needed to go the other direction
To his car
Away from this wilderness

He reluctantly complied

Not 30 yards
Between felled trees

Soon I was reduced
To crawl'n on my
Hand's & knees

Search'n for path

All pitch'd black
The earth itself rattle'n
A madness worthy of legend

Despite the dark
I did not get lost
Use'n no light

Maybe that storm shook me
Also to depths of madness

I saw a beast perch'd
The glitter of his eyes
Not that of deer

It perch'd as sure as a
Mountain Lion
It's form that distinct shape

Give'n it wide berth

Headed to the restaurant

The last of all I had

Many warned me

One such had been

In conspire'n with the neighbor

Smoke'n weed on the porch
Have'n been seen that morn

' Did you see me smoke?

Under such circumstance
I had no choice

Unable to call me a liar
The patron was groundless

In such cleverness
Did he weasel out
Of any requirement for rebuke

B-Rad hustled me a ride
The 30min drive
Back to the trail
I couldn't say no

I asked if we could stop

But the patron
Advised me against such companionship

Placed an altar to the Gods

Seeks & Summits

A climb above
The monotony of hundreds past

Icicle draped cliffs & Monumental boulders
Technical Shifts & Slights

To rise up
Above & Alone
That day October 24th

Of my deepest desires
Sits cast the Impossible wish
To travel to extra-terrestrial spheres

Now at the winter's summit
A feat countless plainly stated Implausible

Lay UnEarthly
Blood-red flatlands

Hosts to grasses
Individually crystallized in ice

Tho hundreds of thousands
Shimmer'd in the wind

Each caught the sun
Each possessed
For that infinitesimal moment

As host to a Supreme Radiance

Changed for that instant
Into unique choirs of light


There caught of heart
The Ordeal done
& Now the moral understood

That Impossible or Implausible
Life can never truly
Be counted out

I often find myself lost deep in pathless bramble
On moonless nights up Slate Canyon

On returning
Unsuccessfully I track my path home

Alone
I look upon the unfamiliar mountainside

At the edge of a broad rock-slide
Or on the boundary of a pitched rock-face

Though there is no moon
I know there is no path

My lost predicament is neither the advance'n
Nor the retreat'n of my journey

It lies in a void of retreat'n yet advance'n
Independent of Time
I react with the universe authentically

Untainted by the idea of answers
Because there is no Future
Without a past
There was never a Question

A sort of somberness sets over me
In this warped & complicated condition

I felt that today
When I was told a certain girl got married

 To keep from freeze'n
Surrounded by the voices of

Overpowered the flame's heart

Again & Again
The bonfire wrought to naught

Awaken'n me to
Cold consciousness & duty

In slumber'n prayer
For a new day

With naught example to follow

An adolescent
Took care of a youngling
No mama there
To protect nor guide

The too-old-to-be-there bear

In destroy'n the aggression
That the sunrise be
A new bond'n relation
Between the master

All to ourselves
Among large lizards & canopy

Jump'n off the 30ft cliff
To waters
Green, clear & warm

We waded back at dusk
Avoid'n the prick of

Round that roof

' What you think Clay

Hit me with immediate revulsion

I approached a girl
On the streets of Cancun

Her at a park
7am with a cat

The cat perched
On her backpack
As she walk'd

She was part of
La Banda

A transient gang in Mexico
That perform & sell
To fund their travels

The day spent
Run'n the streets
Ship'n her clothes
Home to Mexico City

We tested our character
Find'n a kindred need
To dodge cars & roam freely

Everyone gave
Their own peculiar look

First they thought
This girl looks like trouble

The shaved side of her head
Tattooed with leopard prints

Her arm bore
The tattoo of the
Closed Power Fist
Annotated with
' Libres

Shortest Shorts & Boots
A big ass black backpack
Where the Mijares perched

Next they would think
What business
Would this gringo have
With this street girl?

Looked like
I was try'n to buy
& She was sell'n

People on the street
Would yell things to us
That I couldn't follow
She would laugh amused

That was my first day
Back in Mexico

I left in search
Of the Lacandonian Jungle
At 4:20 pm

She gave me an adios
With a kiss on the cheek

When you live life raw
It rewards you
With people you need
When you need them
.
.
.
People listen
To the stories of my life

An adventurer
A pirate

That is how I design
The labor of my devotion

I am primal
The nomadic breadth
In me searches

Towards the open roam
To the free forage

Done in its
Own time & pace

The wilderness offers us
The answer to live harmoniously

Accept the reality of Anarchy

Fight for food
Fight for life
Fight for freedom

My motorcycle is a
Pinnacle of engineering

My server is industrial-grade

My skills grow fast
My body is fit

My unix systems
Exchange information

Anonymous & Insubstantial
As a haunt'n spirit

That Anarchy be preserved
 In this systematic epoch

Where I go I am respected
People listen
To the stories of my life
.
.
.

When the world is wrong
She tells me why

If the path ahead
Serves better as a bed
Her breath births new resolve

Often creativity
A lunatic's lie
The haze of her presence
Become the clouds
From which I fly

Frequently my words hack
Distastefully at the page
Her warm kiss lets me know
She loves me anyway

Responsibility may keep us
Apart for sometime
But not forever
She knows this with
Silent understanding

She is secure our reunion
Will be passionate
Joyous always
Our brief moments

Hand in hand
Under open sky

The grass be forever green

In the jungle you can
Give yourself time
Carry'n food

But you cannot move
Without a machete

My compass spun erratically
I grasped the GPS

Know'n if lost
Would do in the done

Normally
There is up
There is down
There is over
There is under

In the jungle
There is mostly only thru

Thru a medium of plants
By machete

Plant life so thick
I would be suspended 2ft
With 2 packs
Weighing a total of 60lbs

There is no
Watch'n for snakes

Only plunge'n body first
Into an expanse of sharp ferns
Tunnel'n thru webs of vines
Wade'n swamps waist high
That suck downwards
Towards the darkness of the mud

Navigate'n lands
Of invasive creeks
That made landmark'n impossible

There is no sanity

Turn'n right
The GPS shows
A leftward course

Travel'n straight
Towards a short fixed-distance ahead
The GPS revealed
The path a tight circle

For a short time I tasted
What it was
To be the most bad-ass person
I ever met

But now
Several weeks later
I have only one taste linger'n
The tang of defeat

 VII
I swear with exhausted soul
I will only go
To the first bushes

Just to kiss Mary
Then head back to archive

After the joint is rolled
I open the door

Amerith perks up expectantly
From the other side

He came to answer
Mary's smell

No creature
Can smile like dogs

He knows
Tonight will be epic

His misunderstand'n
His fault

After the joint is smoked
I find myself discover'n

A new trail
A better trail

One year by 5mi of mountain
& I have something new
To discover each weekend

The frosted thickets
Pink in the moonlight
Like frozen strawberry milk

But this place is not sweet
Do not reveal yourself

The woods are never empty
Do not disturb the deer
Do not attract the lion

Karma hits like a bitch
From behind with a brick

You just got to take it
Cause that's how women work

A few months ago
I was kicked out of the jungle
By a tribesman with a machete
& Another with a rifle

Can I keep risk'n life
In the pursuit of adventure?
Or do I settle hustle'n
In one place?

Get fat while the get'n is good
I guess

God knows
Adventure'n only feeds you enough
To keep on go'n
.
.
.
 My weapons are of
The Elite Grade

This machete built
Like a cleaver

Distinctly indigenous in structure
The heft of it
Would serve a butcher

Out in the Jungle
That blade served me well

Burst'n into the open
No longer lost & look'n back

Into that deep cylinder
2ft above the ground

Carved by the machete
My exodus like a drill

 Envy would grip
The tribesmen

When they tested
Its decisive cuts
.
.
.
Most memories are
Of dramatic excitements

But now in my age
I wish to cherish

The savor of new mountainsides
Or the small trickles
Of pure springs

Mother Nature's beauty
Is too emense to describe
I can only take away impressions

As many past

Up since morn
Work the day
Home to tinker

Blazed Up & Coffee brew'd

See'n the next sun
Till it well risen

Those who have
fame & honors
poser ass muthrfkrs

Here
How I am
The way I live

This is the
Pinnacle of humanity

No respect
Nor admiration

Pure from fame
Still got game

 I forge a legend
In spontaeous bursts

This life
Is not a choice
Only a reaction

A catalyst towards combustion
When paired to most environments

All torques violently
Where it receives me

Since no one else
 Is go'n to write my Legend
You get this autobiography
.
.
.
In day-to-day conversation
This past year
People commented

' You don't stink
' I thought you would stink

Yeah life got rough
I been at the bottom

Still
The top is always up

2015
Sup
.
.
.
Now I face a dark stage
I am nervous about my
 Journey to the jungle

Streets weren't safe
Preach'n wasn't safe
Trail wasn't safe
Road wasn't safe
Ride'n isn't safe

Technically
If I find a suitable water source
I should be able to survive

Technically
.
.
.
Word to my kind
Who died

Happy High & Drowned
In that lake in Maine

Leave'n 420
As your last written words

Leave'n this life
In Cold's shock

Glad you went a peaceful way
Tho your company
Would be appreciated today
.

One memory I hold special
Of all the 2400 hours uptime

Online in the
World of Warcraft
At the Timeless Isle

We put our self to the work
Of cleanse'n those
Of the faction

Twix bears the symbol
Of our blood-fued
The Horde

Fifteen cyber knights
Of The Horde

Gathered atop
To stop our crusade of kill'n

Us
Three amigos

Charged head upon them
On that hilltop

After much brave fight'n
& Death to The Horde

We charged on thru to
Get The Fuck Out

Khlamidia
The guardian-angel Night Elf

Fearwolf
The Worgan warrior

BarnabyJones
The Warlock

We all got out
Of that fight alive

Cept for Fearwolf
Respect to that fallen homie
.
.
.
When surrounded you hear
' Put your hands
' Behind your head
' We got 17 counts on you

You can then
Understand the life
& What it is like
To be Me
.
.
.
My favorite times
To do wheelies
Are when Christina
Is weigh'n down the back

Once next to a family
The light hit green
The eyes of the family
Plastered onto the minivan windows

As they saw us leap
Upon the back tire

Take'n off
Turn'n left

Thru the intersection
On one wheel
The whole way
.
.
.
Aun in Mexico City
Thousand miles
From the jungle

People knew
From the deep lashes
Upon my arms & legs
I'd been lost in the jungle
.
.
.
Christina advised
' Don't hit too hard

' I smoke Chronic
I shout'd cautiousless

Think'n this only
Pseudo-marijuana

But Ryan & Christina
Snuck in
Salvia-Times-Sixty

Black
Point of Light
Point of Dimension
Point of Area
Point of Corporal
Point of Position
Point of Global
Point of Relations
_

Down the rabbit hole
I fell thru reality

Until I came back up
Out the other side

Remembrance since reboot

I'd say
Life is much
Like a unix computer
.
.
.
Faith

Not something taught
Not something given

Found only
After long darkened toil

Faith
Not to Flip Flop

Faith
To trust a way
Around the impassible river

Faith
To cross 100mi wilderness
Sick & Crawl'n

Faith
The march forward
Dispite all external proofs
To the contrary

Faith
Isn't a knowledge
Of things not seen
That is nonsensical dogma

Faith
Is an All-In

Faith
Know'n the future should fail
Tho continue'n anyway

Faith
Understand'n
This the only way
.

X
The earth my mattress
The heavens my ceiling
The moon my light

My boot
The pillow upon which
I rest my weary head

A peaceful mind
With a simple life

Go'n where I care to go
Stop'n where I care to stop

My only relationship
With the sky & her dramatics

The large expanse
Cares not for my issues

Why should I care for hers?

But as she becomes
Burdened with troubles
So do I

Unable to counsel
Only Listen & Feel

I suffer her tears
I endure to her cry
.
.
.
If Life is hell
But Hell is worse

Then why do you
Now feel so terse?

An email to you my favorite
Deviant Art Artist

nicktheartisticfreak

I am very happy that you would depict my prose
I have changed the project from pedrk.com

My present life would suit best
To be memorialized

Tho I have done great deeds
Of some
Stories told & songs writ
[ autobiographical of course ]

I can deny not
My present life

Suits me best
To Boast & Brag

Enter the master bedroom
In my redneck cousin's house

You take in my
7ft steel unix server

Modular & variant
Are the levels

That compose this tank
Of an archive

You are told this archive
Has substantially
More terabytes of valuable data

Than of any known across
Defcon

ZFSdev.summit

You like the orange Osprey pack
Affectionately hook'd on top

Stained by thousands
Of miles of mountain

' Sun to the right
' Till it never set

You walk around the machine & experience
1337 Hi-Tech
Hacker command center

All black devices emanating
A Razer green light

You count
4-monitors  3-keyboards
8-*puters  10-external drives
Beautifully assembled

BSD 4 Life
Anarchy on the NET

Will you describe that?
In that Hypersexual
Violent & Macabre fashion
Of the pieces
You have long displayed

XI
My 10th Thanksgiving
My sister older by two years

Decided today
Would be the day

At the bay Downtown
Lie a building
Dark Still & Gothic

Once a place of Punishment
Now calling to all
Spirit-Seekers & Adventurers
A Testament to their Ways
-

Beauty is beheld as
Sky Sea & City
Sync in dank motions

Thru thin skin
We absorb'd charged energies

Survey'n the monolith
From the catwalk

Inhale'n Corpus Christi
From on high

Salt Street Decay
Man & Machine

Look'n down to the yard
Of the Courthouse
All Fenced & Boarded

A homeless pass'n & understand'n
Our speculation advise'd

' There
He pointed with his ancient finger
' Thru that hole in the fence

' There
He pointed to a
Particular boarded window
' That one is loose

We watched him meld into Downtown
The plan was too solid to deny

The building is large
& We hard to find
_

Damp Dim & Decrepit
All lie under a layer
Of thick Texan dust

Wooden stairs
Wide & intricately-carved
With 20ft holes

Gape to swallow the unwary
To fall to a deep belly of debris

Like teeth
Its spears wait hungrily
_

All furniture lay piled
In the center
Of each courtroom

Lump'd as one guilty heap
Lawyer Layman Judge & Jury
_

The levels went on & on
Maintain'n solidarity in theme

Matter sentenced
To hallowed depths

Matter consecrated
By memories

All conspire'n to rip down
This ancient Gomorrah
In a suicide's release
_

Condemnation kept to the
Fifth Floor

A place of horror

What light breached
Thru small windows
Was filtered further by bars
Cold Heartless & Demean'n

Have we the right to
Life & Liberty

Expulsion humane
Against this captivity
Under the hands of Beasts

Each cell an altar
Shrines Idols & Sacrifices
Adorned to encapsulate the

Infinite & Individual
Violence of the past

Victims returned on mecca
In Reconciliation

Form'n embodiments
From their suffer'n & bondage

Eject'd & Confined
Back to this temporal limbo

Birth'd & Abort'd
At this temporal junction

Complete'n a cycle
In precious ritual

One cell I remember
A doll bound

Hand & Foot
Stuck & Cut

Graffiti'd with mutilations

Then
My sister grasped my arm
Point'n thru the bars

Deep in the distance
At a large form
Swift & Search'n

' Run
She yelled

We found the stairs
Down & down
In desperate leaps

Unable to distinguish the levels
Pray'n no basement would entrap us

We emerged
Out of that building

Yet on the other side
From where we had entered

Tho young
We were both veterans
To this stage
.

' fk it lets go '
A slogan to which I default

Before death defy'n leaps
Off waterfalls
Into dark waters

Or into gateways
Open & Await'n
_

4am Salty
On the Cancun beach
Caked in seawater grime

The flight landed
Well into the night

I had nowhere to go
But here

I met a hustler
Empty of pocket

This zaney character
A pathway I could not decline

We made concession
I paid for a shower & a bowl

He revealed himself a Magician
& Gave me a potion
Which I drank in prudent sips

The Magick he practiced
Was of the vein of Pain

A scorch embedded
Deep in his flesh
Of a cigar ember held
By his Master
To imbue the brew we drank

His farwell was a forewarn
To not cast the elixir away
_

In the Jungle
Situation compelled me
To discard the elixir
Upon the ground
.

Babe
I'm crazy as hell

How else do you think
I have so many stories to tell

Two Thousand Miles of Mtn
Alone
Of   Course
I am
Just a little bit
     Off

I care little for
Here or There

It is the same
Pretty much everywhere

All I care for is the story

rich dick richard rick skrp
ricardo Elder bitchie-ritchie 3shot

I'm a man of many names
But what you hear of me

May prove Legend

Tho I be
As batty as a second-rate hag

Perk your ear for a hear
I always have something to tell you

Tho you think me kooky
It is because with insanity

I only see thru people
Your presence is purely ethereal
.
.
.
Mania
Diagnosed

Awesome to Live
By those Slopes

Slow ups
Go'n only one direction

& Those fast downs
Rapid but irratic
_

What religious magnificence
Works a fire into blaze

Combustions
Eminate in naked forms

Birth'd
By the hands of Man

Upon the product
Of his Mother Nature

Until ashe
Each sing songs in
Celestial Styles

Freed from
Corporal form

Over 10 long years
I wrote
Over 10 long years
It read `gibberish`

Now at the cusp of 30
The bud has bloomed

The petals of mastery
Set in place & color
_

On the Jordan River Trail
Meander'n among paths
Thru summer reeds

Calm'd by the smell
Of the stale decay

My red pen poised
Cock'd to make
The first mark of many

Tho as I read on & on
Each page
Came & went unstained

The words sang
Songs of Myself
A voice at a tune
All my own

Jason Stevo Isac & I
Captitalized on the custom
Of gas stations

To stack 12 packs of coke
Outside their glass walls

The outside is the side
To which the rambunctious
Lay claim
_

In one elaborate scheme
We hop'd over one fence
& Thru another

Form'n a Daisy Chain
Pass'n the booty under & over

Run'n hands full
Back to the Get-A-Way truck

We charge'd with the exhilaration
Of the unlikely success of execution

Jason our resident
Get-A-Way-Driver
Stood casually outside

His elbow
Prop'd upon on the hood
Of the Red Izuzu

Go! Go! Go!
We clamor

' Can't we got a flat
Jason responded cool
As if a workers union
Protected him

We got away
5mph Down the street
To stop & change tires
_

That day was canonical
Before we rampaged Downtown

The owner of that car
Will drop his jaw
When he realizes
The reason the car won't go

Is because there is a vacancy
Where the battery should be

We four continued on
To a remote haunted airfield
Long abandoned

There find'n a couch
Also abandoned

Lit a bit on fire
Which escalated into a bonfire

In the middle of
The Texan plain
_

Out back in the wastelands
Drink'n our cokes

We enjoyed the view
Of the distant Firefighters
.

Elementary

Spin'n the globe round
Love'n to slightly press
Let'n it stop randomly

Ask'n myself
' Would I go there someday?

Newfoundland always a yes
Remote & To-Itself

Showers

Relishment of renewal
Refresh'n Body & Soul

Cleanse'n off daily scum
Sleep'n naked in sack
Cozy & Peaceful
_

Those years in Mexico
Heat'n the water year-round
With Bucket & Hot-Iron

From Spring to Winter
In the Appalachians
Puddle or Cold-Spring

Out on the streets
Carry'n heavy sack
Civilization at Fingertips

The crave of
The comfort of
Familiarity

I studied maps of the
American Wildernesses

The Selway
I chose as our most wild
_

The nights
A cold Hell

The Ground leeched away
Heat & Sleep
From my back
In timeless torture

Eventually I added
Leaves & Scruff
As insulation to lay upon
Only to discover

The Air leeched away
Heat & Sleep
From my front
In timeless torture

My rations
Honey Soup Garlic & Cheese

Unable to kill naught
But a Rattlesnake's Mother

At the dusk of Winter
Before the teach'n of Spring

The Universe gave a Child
An unlikely opportunity
To retain heritage

The Mother & I fought
Savagely on the cliff

Unable to shoot
With my rifle nor pistol
Against the bare rock of the walls

I set at it
With my Navy Seals knife

10 long minutes of battle
Exhausted my available techniques
Into a shameful stalemate

Then I followed her glances
To a boulder nearby

She saw me look at it
With greedy eyes

I took to it
For a cheap win

With both hands tug'n
Then expose'n

Both
Den & Child

The unjust demands of life
Bade it
Bite or Run

A proper strike
Would have saved both their lives

To my death's remand
The Child fled

Consequently
He smelt the cook'n

Of his mother roast'n
On a riverbed fire
.
.
.
Alone I wander the world
No friend to match my pace
No gaze parallel to my own
A solitary pane of reality
-

In gather'n nests of hackers
None find I familiar

Adventurer tales recounted
Lack true grit

The written word
Our contemporary selfie
-

Why does the caged bird sing?
Channel'n bottled energies
Towards an Inter-Species melody
.
.
.
' Boys will be boys
An elderly lady justified

Green spiked hair
Handmade punk vest
Jinco Jeans
Cut off at the calves
Held up by a dangle'n noose
Boots for stomp'n

I guess I was the peacock of the bunch
But that didn't take out
Any of my kick

Dangerous
Mothers run to cover their children
Men avoid my gaze at all costs

Cops
Security Guards
Thug bitches

But a truck of rednecks
We run from those rich-bred & fed
.

There are many calls
Songs to bring on the night

Fits of Gossip
& Of Communication

Insects Birds Mammals Reptiles
The jungle hosts many

But there is one cry
Best over the rest

The Spanish Mating Call

How could the wild ignore
The commotion of her fuck

Not see the bamboo hut
Standing Tall & Solitary
Shudder in prolonged ecstasy

Resonate'n
From primal loins

Sacred
Irresistible

Those calls of !Que Rico!
From hot-blood

All creatures fall silent
In respect & curiosity

A good-bye to all the men
That were her friends

Leave'n all but one
Want'n with need

Shameless & Proud
Full-bodied
Smooth of pitch
Drawn in longing

For all to hear
But one to answer
.

Google Maps pathed me
To this northern town

North beyond Edmonton
It caters as a crossroads

For the only 2 highways
Continue'n North

An elderly Canadian couple hosted a garage sale
I approached them with an offer
I hope not refused

Twenty American
To lodge my motorcycle on their property

That I should continue on
To the isolated North
By hitchhike

They wouldn't let me leave
Without a full stomach

A dinner of
Friends, family, posterity

A classic canadian meal
Is always complemented
By warm'n a stranger

My lil sis Chistina
Only really ever
Says dumb things

Lose'n sense of height
Degrade'n black people
In a Jamaican jungle
Near a black man with a machete

Or in Washington DC
Insist'n a local
The National Monument was the Pentagon

Or in front of Walmart exclaim'n
' Oh shit its the Cops!
5ft from the cops

Diarrhea
Deadly flush of the bowels

Christmas Eve
I nearly died

Ulcers Fever
Salmonella & Pneumonia

Find'n the doctor in the church

Take'n her from her guests
Enjoy'n las fiestas

With Her & my companion
She tells me I need a shot

I roll up my shirt sleeve
They look at me not understand'n

' No you need to bend over
' In Mexico we shoot by butt

Merry Christmas Elder

Oh that night on the open road
The only road continue'n North

There at
Indian Cabins Beer & Liquor

The owner exhibited gold
He sifted from a nearby stream

To a speculate'n
Province Surveyor

I spectated
Despite the owners distrust

The surveyor asked where
I was headed

He took me in
With his eyes for a time

You best buy
Yourself some beer

This is an isolated place
Of unsatiated alcoholism

I'll take you as far
As the 60th Parallel North

There you will be left
To Mercy & Mosquitoes

Hold that beer high
Promote it with all you've got

Mayhap this night
You find yourself in Yellowknife

Howbeit
If you are stuck
At the 60th Parallel

Naught a sign nor house
Within 600 kilometers

Be grateful
Here the sun never sets

Be grateful
For your twelve pack

Two officers of 14 years
Lied in court
That I fought them

For justification to arrest me
Cause I was irritated
With a Transit Cop front'n up to me

Granted I did troll them
Before the hearing
As only a master could

Several months later
After the internal investigations filed
I saw the Officer

Maybe I feel regret
Understand'n his current state
But maybe not

Fk the police

Once hitch'n
I got high with a father
& His teenage son

Haven forgotten
I was in the backseat

The two continued their argue
A tension that gave no repose

The son said he felt awkward

' You fucked all my girlfriends
' That makes me feel awkward

The father broke free
His bottle'd pressure
That tensed each interaction
With his son

Say'n what need'd to be said

I felt awkward
When they remembered me
.
.
.
When I come roll'n thru
Ain't nobody you ever met
Like me

Whatever you learn of me
You always remember

Settled hazel gaze
Irritatite'n smirk
Apparel innately agressive
Beard Un-tame'd & Wild

At the last gas station
Before the US Border
Alberta side

Have'n the odd misfortune
To run out of gas
At the only place
That didn't have Premium

At the exact place
I ran out of gas
More than a week earlier

The attendant of this
One Pump Station

Remembered me distraught
From the first time
Have'n to settle for non-Premium

Stuck in the middle of pastures
Never seen most of
What was on the TV

Then to see me
A wayward traveler

Champion of adventure
A symbol of
Something-Now-Lost

Cheerily you asked
' When will you be back

' Likely never
I respond
' Where I go I seldom return

I mostly meet strangers
Strangers see me
Most accurate for who I am

4am
On a winter's night

A night spent explore'n
The limits of the trail

Something came off the mtn
Its echos follow'n our own

A dark form stalked up
To the boulders at our back
Yet at a distance

We fled into the outer city
To drink from a sprinkler

It prowled over the highway
Follow'n

Head'n back to the canyon
30min later

On the other side
From where the beast
Had crossed

Shadowed by the headlights
Of the only car
Out on this abandoned stretch of road

Creep'd the form of Mtn Lion
In my blind spot
Perch'd to pounce

Scared across
Into a parking lot by the car
The Mtn Lion drew cover

Scared across
The wide pavement of the highway
Amerith & I flew

A quarter mile later
Forced to go the long way
8mi Around

I walked over
A sleep'n homeless
The Mtn Lion likely still tracked us

Remote still
This place above the tracks

Try to explain that to a homeless
Who didn't even accept money

Offered in an attempt
To pave a way to explain
The dire situation he was in

Better off he just not know
Nor feel regret at not believing
The story of a killer beast
.
.
.
If on a rainy day
You caught shelter
During the intensity of the storm
In the underground tunnel
Under the road

Huddle'n there
You saw me coming

Large umbrella
Enshroud'n a bearded man
With a Hi-Tech Nike jacket
All black & hooded tightly
Expensive jeans & kicks

Ask'n you what time it was
I approached & I passed
To allow your nervousness relief

But then stop'n
At the other end
Of that dark & deep tunnel

I asked again
' What time was that?

' 4:20
You respond again

' Oh well
' I got to be get'n back again
' Sorry
I respond in answer

Apologize'n
Because of the fear
Left forgotten on your face
Endure'n the suspicious repass'n

Yes

I've been told
I'm Self Absorb'd

Still
Don't give a fk

Russians catalogued millions of books
Into a database

It replicated & transported
Via torrent protocol

Most of its mirror'd databanks
Unearthed & Eradicated
But not all


In time I managed
To uncover the treasure
Of its repository
Folded in the deep
_

Months & Months
Turn'n to years
I have dedicated
Towards its acquisition

That this foreign
Yet humanitarian feat

Attain'd to retain
Our species intelligence

Be not lost
Due to tyrants & their greed

Deep in the Jamaican Blue Mountains
Thru the twisty narrow
Red dirt road

Christina & I roamed
The landlady's dog
Trail'n at our heels

The mutt displayed
Vivaciousness & Worth
Chase'n off cars

' Richie we got to stop it
' It will get hit!

I reply annoyed
But mathematically

' Christina
' The dog lives on this road
' What are the chances

' That of all the days

We had to return
The landlady her dog
Bloody & missing a toe

I was once approached
By a man
He was well-built
From his lifetime
Build'n with bricks

With only a few months in Mexico
Spanish easily eluded me

What I had misinterpreted
As friendly conversation
Was revealed a dire situation

When my Mexican missionary companion
Took shelter in my shadow

' Voy a rompar tu cara!
The bricklayer exclaimed fiercely at me

After he had taken the time to narrate
The mistreatment he had endured in America

My order bound me
To play the sacrificial lamb
& Take the asskick'n like a man

' Mira tu camisa
My companion squeaked from behind me
Point'n to the enrage'd man's shirt

The man unclenched his fists
& He unclenched his jaw
Which dangled open & loosely

As he stared down stoopified
At the large American Flag
He wore on his chest
.
.
.
People think
Because we are not compatible
I have some defect of character

They say I am too cocky
& I am of pure embellishment

But I see them
In complacent lives

Compared against
My great history of Adventure

What regard or relation
Could I associate with such beings

Precious souls as mine
Encounter few kindred spirits

Those I meet
Are mostly incompatible

Life goes on
In different ways
For different days

I cherish my life
Love yours

Mayhap you one day enact
a story to behold

I once met a witch
One hot summer in Mexico

Her abode
Uncannily cold upon our arrival

By the time we took our leave
The temperature would oddly normalize
Back into a noonday oven

With her mother
They would dig up the dead

To enchant the body parts
& Bind the unfortunate souls

To reveal ancient wealth
Or conspire them into curses
_

Witchcraft was rampant
As well as the worship of
La Santa Muerte

I ventured there
To preach & teach

Two long years of righteousness
& Chaste workings

Odd
Years later it was I
Who had been converted

To the only scientific god
' The bringer of true Peace
_

All your children are equal
You will visit me
I will see your face

May my death be quick
& The Peace-of-Nothingness everlasting

Viva La Santa Muerte

The day the Lacandonians
Kicked me out of their jungle

I returned to the nearest city
Beat down & depressed

Cancun
Several states away

Yet the girl I'd met there
More than a week prior
Was not 10 blocks away

Around 10pm
She showed up drunk

Drink'n the clear liquid
As natural as water

' Come with me to my hut
' In the jungle
' I'll take you where
 ' There are mango trees
' Stay with me tonight

She told me with those
Big beautiful bloodshot eyes

I said my goodbyes to the hostel
To a bed that I'd never sleep in

From that moment on
I began my adventure with
La Chilanga
.
.
.
The primal breadth in me searches
Towards that open roam
To that free forage
Done in its own time & pace

The natural world offers freely
The simple answer to Harmony

Who can reject
The face of this truth

Plain as the sun
It confirms the soul

Observe'n the wild where
Each Species Different & Compete'n

Accept their place
Respect no master
.
.
.
I'd lost my chance
To befriend wild monkeys

Like how I'd been unable to befriend
The adolescent bears of the Appalachians

They always ran
Tho I chased them
Call'n sweetly with treats
.
.
.
 My weapons
Are of the Elite Grade
MK-3 MOD 0 is no exception

Undercover & Accessible
Out on the road

In my pack
 Hitch'n or Cruise'n

Once at a park
South of Calgary

Where the flood has destroyed half the town
Pump'n out the contents of the sewers

A cop kicked me up
Look'n for a felon

I went easily back to sleep
A Scout is always prepared

 Consequences if assault'd
She would deliver with cruelty
.
.
.
I have gathered firewood
Thru the entire night
With a selected few

Out in the cold June forest
Past midnight in the
Parc de la Gatineau

The pit at the summit
Of roll'n wilderness

The homeless stranger & I
Search'd desperately
For firewood all night

Night a terrible cold
Like only Canada knows

' I can walk with you
' And show you the way
A UoO student got off his bike
To walk with me 15 min

Tho I merely asked
The name of the street
Always glad for company

His parents the
Classic Canadian Arizona Snowbirds

He advised I revise my plan
' Parc de la Gatineau
' Will be more gauranteed
_

20min down the path
' Utah!

Someone called out back

 ' There are free maps
' I brought one for you
' Didn't want you to get lost
' On my account

Cultivate a people
Sensitive to the core

Mexicans use concrete structures as houses
Which keep heat like ovens

Beneath
The North Mexican desert sun

Up on the foothills
A cool breeze was to be had

By sleep'n on the roof
In this poor mountain village

Not one night had passed
My missionary companion & I woke
To see football-sized concrete boulders
Shatter'n inches from our heads

The un-entertained poor
Showered down meteorites from the mountains

Crash'n in heaps
All around us
_

Ain't nothing new
From remains

Left by un-entertained poor
I'd seen so far

Dogs been bound by wire
& Burnt alive

Dogs dangling from the nooses
Lashed on trees

Puppies poisoned
Into excruciating deaths

For sport from want of recreation
_

This was my missionary companion's
First & only area on his mission

He hurt himself
In attempts to be excused honorably home

I never understood why he left
.

I arrived in Hong Kong
With nowhere to go

I took 5 trains
To the islandic mountains

After meeting friends
We ate at a
Remote white-sanded beach

Rumor told of a waterfall
Just around the mountain side

Tho it was late
My companions headed out
As dusk came

A waterfall to leap from
Is worth whatever risk

Under the hot Hong Kong sun
I climbed

Up & over the mountainside

To the back reaches
To the waterfall

To arrive alone
At the last rays of day
&
 Take the leap
Into untested dark waters
.

Once as I hitch'd to Canada
The guy give'n me the lift
Offered me a job with his brother Jeff

' In about 4 different ways

Yesterday
I woke in a fit of compulsion
By 7am my pack was ready

A certain day of the year
Inspires me

I took the train to its
End-of-the-line
North to Ogden

After consult'n
With the local homeless
I found the spot
To hitchhike North

Today
There was only one canyon
Between me & Helena
After 5 hours I became defeated


A rickity car pulled over
I shoved my heap of things
Into the back seat with me

They were a couple in their early 30's
Who offered me drink
Of clear liquid
From a Sprite bottle
That I declined

Further down the road
I repack'd the pile into my bag

The man drive'n
Commented wrily

' You won't be needing
' To worry about that soon

I tensed at the comment
They laughed in that lofty
Too High To Give a Fuck tone


Slowly I realized
As the car began
Careless drifts

The situation was entirely different
From what I had suspected

I released the grip of my blade
That was tuck'd out-of-sight
But never out-of-reach


The car began
More dramatic swerves
Enter'n the canyon

From the outer edge of one side
To the outer edge of the other

On this two lane highway
Northwards Butte to Helena

Our velocity a constant 80 mph

Each turn a hope for death
But never
With commitment to end

Typical of
Passive Hippie Pussies


It was thirty miles
Of canyon twists

Before the police
Chased us down

Faced to make the choice
The weak caved
_

Death has always been
A familiar face

But it was this
Long & intimate dance
That won my love


A true Celebration
Of my birthday

I was alive
But born again
.

Ferry Ride
All night

To Newfoundland
Out on deck
Closest to the ocean

Rumor told
' Gros Morne
' Remnant of the Applachians

Providence Unfold'n
The next day hitch'n

Five rides
Like fate brought me

Up those bogs
Of Gros Morn
I felt I walked
With an ancient Native

Feed'n the animals
Understand'n a different way

Three days to travel
For one night
Three days to return
_

In Benos Aires
I stayed a month with a cult

That allowed spirits to dance
All night in their bodies

I wouldn't deny
Such understand'n
.
.
.
I live a lawless life

Far or Near
Govt reigns supreme

Beast or Man
No earth to be free

An omnipresent foe
Heretorefore unimagineable

Fear can not stop me
That at risk
Worth much more than mere life

' Beware: Do not feed the monkeys
' They form gangs
' To rob people of their food

Monkey Hill
Hong Kong

My quest took two afternoons
End'n as I crossed the bridge

To a hill full of monkeys
Who needed a champion

The Historical Sign read
The monkeys were imported

 To eat the poisonous plants
Around the riverbanks
In order for this area to be founded

Now this Beware sign asks
Abandon the monkeys
To forage on their own
_

I've always wanted
To be a gang leader

Befriend these packs of monkeys
With a feast
They would recognize my value

My pack was full
Of different foods
I'd been accumulate'n
For this celebration

The monkeys may just raid
Me & my camp
Attack'n me in the night

The monkeys may just like me

They would recognize my friendly power
& Unite under my scheme'n

Either way
This was to be a party to never forget
_

Above a shrine of stone
At the point of a foothill
I set up camp for the rain

My 2nd hammock lashing
Was not in my bag
Was not in my pack
Not anywhere to be found

That slight piece of equipment
Would betray me of shelter
From the hard rain to come
_

Head'n from Monkey Hill
Back to downtown Hong Kong
 1:30am I wandered directionless

Earlier Ducki commented
She always wanted
To enter a building
But was too scared
The Indians were always fighting outside

Sure enough
As we entered
A flock of seven Indian males began fight'n

Like small sparrows
do in a bicker

-

Now across the street
Was that same building
An Indian approached me

 With an offer I could not refuse
My own room for under $30

Sure enough
He had to fight against another Indian
But he got us to the elevator

I'd never been on an elevator that small
That had to go so high
.
.
.
The black Jamaican
Hosted us in a room
The room had a painting

A quiet night of a white family
Dining in their home
A black man poised
With a rifle outside their window

The painting read
' Never Forget

I researched pathways on Google Maps
Of one Hong Kong Island

Nighttime on the pathway
I saw lights
Swift & Search'n
 Miles off
At the other end
Of this ocean cove
I assumed it a Lighthouse

At the other end
Of the ocean cove
I found no lighthouse

Only a sign in
Cantonese & English
But I care naught for adversements

Up the only path
Up the hill to a village
Which cultivated the slopes
Of this Mountain Ravine

There near the summit
Lay a house
Large Wooden & Old

Odd to see a non-vacant house
Look Dead & Still

Farm paths led different places
I stayed on the path
That led to the mountain pass

The search'n lights I'd seen
From the other end
Of the ocean cove
Were now focused
On something at the mountain pass
The lights became many

The action of the beams disturbed me
By the nature of its frantic movements
To the extent I decided to retreat

Failed & deeply distraught
I knew this the only path

I headed back
There repass'n the sign
I stopped to read it

 ' If you cross this border
' You trespass
' Into a private village
' We will assume you are a thief
' And treat you accordingly

DefCon 23
Dropped off in Las Vegas
Alone with no plan at night

Under 20 minutes
I sat hold'n a
Black dealer's
Gold chain

To get my weed

Las Vegas lights are trippy
When you are high

Smoke'n a joint
You roll'd out back

The lights to my back
Turned out to be
Not the cops

But that fright had startled me
My smartphone
Fell & shattered

Destroy'n any way to contact
Those who had my room

From Wed morning at 7am
Till Saturday afternoon at 3pm
 I went without sleep

After rummage'n thru a hostel
For leftover food

The workers trim'n the trees
Proselytized their community
As place to stay & eat

We traveled to their land
On the wealthy side of Virginia

This cult held
 ' All Things In Common

It was weird all over
Felt just like
My mormon childhood

An old Lady & I haggled
In a tucked away shop
On an off-season
Stretch of beach

She wouldn't let the piece go
But at a steep price

Nevertheless
The season was mine
' I will pay $80
' Get more cash
' And pay more in the morning

Context communicated
I don't have the cash
Take comfort in a false gamble
To save face

A split second betrayed her concession
As the woman was about to respond

Christina decided to chip in
 ' I promise we will come back
' You can totally trust us

I had to lecture Christina
That during the logistics of hustle'n
Shut The Fk Up
Now the lady has cause to curse

That Jamaican JuJu
Haunts me to this day

But I cannot part
With the Ironwood Artifact

Unless you know it


Glue-stained nostrils of the fathers
Dirt floors & crude appliances
Of needful things

Children abused & forsaken
Where hopelessness is indeed

This work is only ever read
Under the force
Of my personal stare

I must reaffirm
That great works

By definition
Should never be grasped
Freely by whomever

Few should ever really relate

But that is the catch isn't it?
To find the few
The masses must echo

Life is a bitch
But one has to carry on
As one must

I rose like I had everyday since
Gather'n wood for the breakfast fire

I also mistakenly
Gathered a snake

The copperhead sleepy still

I kicked Christina awake
Threw her machete at her
Command'n her to kill it

The snake woke real fast
As Christina missed

They fought thru the bramble

The copperhead strike'n
Christina miss'n

Despite the undergrowth
Christina kept her focus

The snake dove
 Into a leap'n strike

The machete SHINK
Split the air

The open-mouthed head
Severed from its body

Spin'n out into the distance

3Chop held the severed body
With one hand

Then peeled down
The copperhead's skin
Off with the other

3Chop tore out the guts
Washed the twitch'n corpse
 In the river

Built a fire
Roast'd the unseasoned meat
& Ate

3Chop & 3Shot
A memorable Duo
Throughout 400mi of Appalachian Mtn

Our parents in the van behind
All on the road to our cousins

A Ford Mustang
Pulled up aside

Its engine call'n me out
Disrespectfully

On green we lurched forward
Leave'n my startled parents
In the wake of fumes

Would accompany me

Upon the Urban Streets

The length of this incomplete Overpass

100ft above
The ground far below

' If you make a mistake you will die

Sawyer took upon a great boulder
Which to climb

Weeks of leech'n
Accumulated to acquire it whole

Internet's Best Compilation Of
How To Seduce Women

Such a thing was impossible
I proclaimed defiantly
For to leech
One must first Seed

For this monument
To not only exist
But be served consistently
Escaped any rationality

The world is wide & weird
Still Darwinian limits
Inhibit all matter

At a party with my cousin's cousin
I discovered
He had been a Seed

I regret many things I've told women
Truth isn't always best for them

Out on that Reservation Road
Of the Nez Perce

Hitch'n for a ride
But everyone pass'n


A rickity car pulled to the side
Inside I look at the driver's side to see

Daisy Duke & Blonde
As redneck as can be

' You are the prettiest person
' To ever pick me up
I add to my thank you


~ Oh your boyfriend
~ Just broke up with you
~ You shouldn't pick up at 17
~ Just drop me off

She took me up a mountain top
To leave me stranded

While she went home
To ask her parents
' if I can keep you


She picked me up a while later
As I walk'd down
Her mother in the front seat

' My mom was okay with it
' But my dad
' Didn't like the idea

Always look before you get in

Burn'd untemper'd

The Anarchist Cookbook
One of the best reads

The Tennis Ball Bomb
The only recipe
That performed remarkably

It lay on my shelf
Untested for weeks

Until my temper burn'd
Thru all sanity

Grab'n & Throw'n Blindly
I launched the bomb

For a time
I stared at it enamor'd

Despite its deep position'n
In the closet

The match-heads burst out
In healthy flow
Land'n & stay'n lit

Match-heads ejected

My entire world
A layer of flame

That West Side gang park

The one with the concrete table
That looked as the ones of stone in my books

Past midnight
Alone & Ready
To bolt at any shadow

But it was car lights
That turn'd on behind me
Parked tuck'd away
It slowly follow'd me
Down the street

Then at the sudden
Burst in a lurch at me
& Past me

Fkn cop had a good laugh
He drove off with his joke
For the day

The ring of that havoc
True & Forever

Carries true that deep ring
Of havoc

Roam'd our stomp'n ground
Look'n for something to stomp

3 Hoodlums travel'd
To our city
 A hood from the North

Look'n for what troublemakers look for
There find'n us

Temporary & Complementary
Were the forces that created our unique body

Like the combustion of celestial bodies
To form planets
Or destroy them in magnificence

Once there was a place
That would not reject us

An abandoned warehouse
Known in the annals as
Skatehouse


Cross the street of
Miller High School

Lay the drab forgotten graveyard
Of my kin

Up & Thru
That graveyard fence
Bordered another
More recent graveyard

After those borders
You come to a grassy pathway

To where we
Cut a pathway

Thru a fence of wire
To a building
Abandoned long ago

Its concrete lot
As spacious as the oceans
Too much space to ever skate

Once some sort of
Newspaper printery
Newspapers stacked in heaps
_

Once sleep'n above in the
Overlook'n Overlord Office
All Unventilated & Grime

The night had been a wild
Party in the Graveyard

Eight of us lay there
Javi Javier Dorsey
Sal Jesus Homer
My older sister & I

Upon the 70s carpet
Caked in dust

Like sand
In a beach-side tent

Around yellow'n paper of
70s Playboy

My older sister & I
Lit them upon the candles
Spread around for light

After throw'n them
At each other

The fun spread like fire
All Toss'n & Avoid'n

We had to escape
Thru the cemeteries

As the firefighters came
Ban'n us forever
From a home span'n several months

On the streets

Roanoke offered me refuge
After the cataclysmic storm hit

Met people thru people
I was with people I'd met
From those people after that

Power been out for weeks
That crazy-muther-fkr
Who hosted me
Traded internet for bud

Maybe it was that bowl
But I do know
He was one crazy-muther-fkr

I peace'd out of there
A bit past midnight

In the center of the city
Jam'n to Die Antwoord

Someone call'd me out
From behind

From the bush that skirt
A grassy hill

Burst out a large man
Toward me
Face full of tats

' You travel'n too?
He offered friendly gather'n
To his camp at the hillcrest

Zach & I hung out
All night on that foothill

Hell I didn't have
Anywhere else to go
But right here

We trade'd stories of adventure
But he trump'd me de facto
Once he killed a guy
With a pipe

That short time was of friendship
& Shared mutual respect

Now I ain't say'n Zach wasn't Scum
But he definitely ain't Trash

Stories told & Songs said
In the tales during my youth
Always up a tree with a book

Wish'n I were the protagonist
Of some adventure

In a magical wonderland
Or in post-apocalyptic distress

Since my first morn'n out
On the Appalachian
Till now settled for the season

Reflect'n on my life
A story only Life could forge

The beauty & depth
The deepness of space

My weapons
Are of the Elite Grade

Ruger 357 Magnum Revolver
The wideness of the barrel

Matched by the girth
Of the steel

Acquired as a reminder
To never encounter a Mountain Lion
Unarmed again

Out this night
3am Deep in the bramble

The sound of approach'n
Is unmistakable

Once heard
It betrays fully its intention

There the fear is full
_

Fortune placed us securely
In an opening of the thicket

A small boulder & brush
At the center
10ft of open space at all sides

Surrounded by
Twists & Distortions
Vegetation warped by
 Stony soil

Magnum drawn
I tough talked the Lion

There are some notes
That are inter-species

You play your tune to its beat
& All will understand

To communicate
To this cocky beast

Tho this be his grounds
Tho he perceive
No foreseeable threat

I had something
Past his imaginations
That would blow
His brain out his skull

Vocal courage to break'n
To this cat's cowardice
_

20 mins passed in stalemate
The next move
Would be the beasts

It's presence
No longer heard but felt

Positioned behind the boulder
Face'n the direction
The beast had been descend'n

I focused forward
In dominate stance

My place sure
Until the beast's presence
Surely heard to the bramble
At my back

The 3am moon
Is not always bright
It wasn't bright tonight

It had successfully
Made the lengthy distance
Creep'n in circle around me

Without noise
Until that moment
Thru some preplaced path

My note & my tune
Unflustered by the sudden shift

My position I knew
Breached only partially

Upon my stolid reaction
To the change of events
Echo'd by communication

With the surprise of slyness
A cat's pride
Indisputably thwarted
Returned a growl of frustration

I can only swear
What I believe I heard

Fear truly infects sanity

All I know for certain is
Amerith would refuse to go
Into those brambles depths again

Corpus Christi
No place like home

Same corners
I peed on as a teen
Those punk years
Never to be forgotten

On hard streets
Mostly at the bay Downtown

Forever to yearn
 Those warm salty drifts
Stinging with sand

Full of the caw
Of that great body of christ

Its proud Skyline
 & Harbor Bridge

Splashed
By forever muddled waters

Celebrate'n New Years
With a discarded Christmas Tree
Set up in sand & adorned

With Gas & Explosives
A Herald to a new cycle

1337
Long eluded me

A child built on DOS
Distracted by the colorful windows of 95

Punk teenage years squandered
In the hustle
Of illicitly-traded binaries

Attempts been made to rise up
Yet the time wasn't right

College years came by & went
Still the time wasn't right

The January summer spent in Buenos Aires
Nose down a dense unix text

Fresh blind'n despair
Those 6 mo of unsuccessful installs

Tho hampered by hardware
I found myself at a FreeBSD terminal

Despite 900 pages
Of technical reads
I could produce
Only DOS commands

That was when
I swore off the 1337 dream
Forever

Squander time no more
Against obstinate deficiency
_

But nothing lasts forever
Stubborn
& In the pits of esteem

Work'n underpaid at a firm
Finally Stable & Able

The time was right

1337
 Come'n forward with vendetta

Noob foothills where
 I had spent my history lost
Now obscured
By vast expenses

Depression & Trial
Still carve my path

Tho the mantle of Disdain shed
Never to be worn again

Now worthy of 1337
Now relieved
I never kept my word

Consume'n free time
Exchange'n needful time

Need'n above all else
To reach respectful heights

Where ability
Has become craft
Evolved to skill

Is Gone as rot

 Fuel the future

As the Stegasouraus & Fern

Age is something
Ever to be fear'd

But as most things in life
Near the end
 It is at its sweetest

 Prose Wordsmith
Adventurer True Grit
Unix Hacker 1337

All these activities
Mediocre at best
During my youth


Now at the cusp of Age
Those titles I hold true

Thru such pathways
I see hopeful horizons

Every moment as Testament
To Lifestory
.
.
.
To tell her who I love
That such relation is taboo
To those who
Walk in the path of
La Santa Muerte

To H.P. Lovecraft
To William Blake
To me

Life is for the sow'n
To the Reaper
To reap the rewards

Let action & life
Only ever be for
His memory of me

Since my days strapped
By The Man
To my desk as a teen

Since my days sworn
To The Man
To selflessness as a preacher

My mind ever roam'd toward
The Full Pack
& One-Way Path

I gather'd my courage
To dream no more

Bought my Pack
Bought my Bag
Bought my Beanie
Bought my Sweater

 Bought the airfare
A ten day trip to
The Mexican Rivera

Land'n there
With no plan
Or idea of where-to-next
Like I always plan'd

The guy aside brush'd me off
On that long distance
Bus to the beach
I shrugged it off

Later he passed me
His cell phone
' Soy sordo

Sergio invited me on a boat
To Cozumel

Where I met his
Deaf wife & deaf child
& Deaf friends

That night have'n no hotel
Took the overnight bus
To Chetumal

Where I met a Japanese girl
Lay'n down next to
The biggest black pack
I ever seen

Akane invited me to
Backpacker Island
On The Belize Reef

There among
The Islandic Indigenous
There engrossed
A place where life
Is readily forgotten

Days Later Burnt
I bought a joint
From my Rastafarian Host
Deep in the Belize Jungle

The crisp of my skin
Demanded it as medicine

But I decided it was time
To end the long hiatus
Since high school

Mary then was only
An old fling

Married now years later
I have never been as happy

No longer a Dreamer
Adventure'n in Season

The perfect hustle
Accomplished by a wiley
Black guy in Belize City

I cannot decline
Certain requests

Somehow drag'n me
To the cornerstore

Hold'n that bread
Hold'n that Spam

Proof what his family needed
_

He had definitely bought booze
Ealier for what
He should have spent
On groceries

Tho if despite
Such addiction & need

A man can manage
To care
To care for others

He is as much of a man
As any I met

Hitch'n
Backcountry roads

Thumb like a sifter
Filter'n the masses

Patient for those
Kindred to me

The foundation
Of this connection
Laid in their past

Upon me
They reflect & remember
The open road & free flow

They bestow upon me counsel
Of wisdom learned
In their day

A lineage of adventurers
___

Upon the Newfoundland
Windswept barrens

Exhausted from the long haul
Erroded like the coast

Each pass'n car
Beats me by bits

Like the waves
Against the rocky bay

A large block of cheese
& Half bagel in my hand

Dried meat
& Half bagel
In my mouth

Stand'n up
Thumb out

I seen your car rise
On the dreary horizon

Hope is all one really needs
After long hiatus & failure

One ride can propel you
Forward to the finish

A laborer
In the oil fields
Of Alberta

Have'n hitched in your day
Bored this day recover'n
From carpul tunnel surgery

Your wife take'n care
Of the elderly man

Now parapalegic
From collide'n with a moose

On his way home
From babysitting your boy
_

I appreciate the ride
To Crab River

But I treasure
The powwow we shared

Map out
& You assure'n me
By logistics
I could make
Gros Morne that day

By bus
On boat

Walk'n long
Hitch'n far

Up to the bogs of Gros Morne
End'n the day hammock up

We exchanged names
Multiple times

Know'n we would
Never remember

But each time hope'n
This over others different

Woes of failure against
Man Beast Machine

Cries to echo
Throughout the halls
Of my internal being

Mathmatical waves
Breach the horrors
Of infinities
_

My core
Deep-seated dream
Sits cast the desire to
Live off the land

In the Selway Wildreness
Grouse critter like vermin

In good position
Starve'n
I took aim & fired

The bird burst
Like a balloon of feathers

Instead of continue'n ahead
It juke'd backwards alive
Down the ravine

I unsheathed the knife
Laid down the rifle

& Chased it into the bramble
Until enraged & ashamed

I was forced to concede defeat
Outsmarted by a Grouse

Also seriously injured
From sprung knee
_

Failure is the pain
To accept

What you dreamt
Wasn't suited for you

The life of beasts
Free of our system of captivity

Much more
Precious to me

Nightime hang'n in
Newfoundland bogs

Alone as before
Wild as ever

Something terribly wrong
With my position
In this world

At the end
Of this conquest

Anxiety a sith force
Fuel'n my adventures
My entire life

Now turn'n its face
Against what it forged

It tore at my soul
In a canker of the heart

Take'n the form of Homesickness
Bore'n in dramatic penetrations

Carved now
A man into his 30s

Not the wild boy
Of Pan Legend

Someone stand'n firm
With courage to settle

In ritual of this rebirth
My wild unkempt beard
Shed

With exposed chin

I build a homestead

' If the fool would
' Persist in his folly
' He would become wise

Still far from wise
I leave that to the elderly

Those afraid to venture
Over the ramble of mistakes

In the odessey
Towards new answers

The recipe to taste
Delight in ones life

Nights spent
On hard strange grounds

Days choose'n
Doors to divergent trajectories

If I were to be wise
I'd teach

' Life has no mistakes

You are either dead
Or you aren't
_

Complete in despair
Lost in the jungle

' You estimate yourself
' With such arrogance

' Let me back
' Into my American cage

' & There learn gratitude
' For the simple things

' & Die some time
' Other than now
.
.

No race accepts me
No social body kindred

I only know how to treat others
As strangers

Someone seen
In the blur of a passerby

Someone only understood
After they are
Nameless in memories

Memories a sea
Of the-such

Waves crest
Of longlost faces

Glimmer'n in
What made them unique

Flicker'n with
The clarity of reflected sun
.

No one who knows me
Could deny my intelligence

A restless mind
Caught up in union
With an untame heart

The anarchy of nature
A neverend'n story

Together tho polar
We sing these
' Songs of Myself

Fk the world
& Fk you too

You will all know
I made it on my own

After I succeed
When no one else
Believed in me

I don't care
If its now or never

Deep down inside
Its always been
Predetermined since before

Like the Lion
The King of his sphere
Always has a wild
Tale to be told
.
.
.
Alone
I find the friend
Best suited for me

Of thousands
In infinite variation

He who I really miss
Is me in solitude

Unreigned I prowl my planet
This sphere where I king
In this moment of glory

First night of workweek
Spent in celebration

Japanese Beer
Roasted beef on bone
My wife's kisses

Mary's juicy ass
On the oven

Reread'n my writing after all
Have proclaimed my works a Loss

Stubbornly I see only
Beauty & Vividness

Celebration to me
& I the only attendant

Life is most happily spent
In an accustomed enviornment

 XXXXVII
Smoke'n a cig with a
Homelss ex-carnie

I needed tolietries
He led me to the store
Where he exchanges
Bottles for beer

I been around homeless
Since I was a child

Like any wild beast
Once you get to know them

You know the places
To take liberty
_

Before the Overpass
Over a small river

A guy on a skateboard
Staggered by

Obedient to my rule no.1
I asked him a question

In reality only care'n
For conversation

' I'm with a group
' Come check it out

He led me curiously
To the local homeless shelter

Definitely not a place
To take liberty

All outside
Late at night

Managed to get
$10 worth of weed

Unfortunately that meant
Get'n change from a $20

The recipe
For night long paranoia
_

The homeless tag'd along
Want'n to go hitch'n with me

Always happy for company
Tho never off my guard

We went to the forests

I warned him
Of the cold of night

He countered
He was Canadian

I taught him
To make fire from a candle
When wood is wet

He taught me
How to keep that fire going

Until 4am
Constantly gather'n wood

Poverty casts dark shadows

I've been offered children
I've seen the result
Of that life in older children

Terrible scenes
Arise like fungus in

Horrors Hell

History is evil
Good comes naturally

Evil a scheme'n
Which must be invoked

In a summons

Atrocitices of Alchemy

Exchange'n life

America in WWII
Traded youth

For spoils stolen from
Another man's war

I make
Critical mistakes

The sun set'n
30min & No taxi to take us

The off-season in
Jamaica is harsh

I could not explain
Why all my efforts
To reach the
Government yards of
Trenchtown
Met with rejection

In a season when all
Reduce'd to beg'n

Trap'd on an island
Troubles are shared by all
_

Finally arrive'n
To Trenchtown by taxi
The driver pointed
Where Bob Marley lived
Then took off

I misunderstood the song
Thinking the Yards
Some city square where he would perform
_

Caves of poverty
Concrete square rooms

Bare walls on 5 sides
Continue'n in rows

Bob Marely proved
Destiny can pull from
The deepest pits
_

Immediately I knew
Our serious predicament

Now understand'n
Why other taxi did not take us

Since the start Christina
Would not listen to reason

White girl
In the shortest shorts

I looked around for any advantage
Know'n I must focus

On how to survive
In Trenchtown past 8:30pm

False Compliments
I hate most of all

Preschool
Proudly show'n art

A Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtle

The adult gave
High praises

Such that I became alerted
Skeptically

Look'n anew at the paper

A Circle

Putrid is the taste
When forced to swallow
Undeserved compliments

I studied poverty
From teen to adult

Conclude'n always
Some things in life
Can't change

Submit'n to passivity
Against child man or elderly

Eat'n cactus raw

Pick'n stray stale pasta
Loose from torn garbage bag

Chase'n Dorito crumbs
Sift'n thru trash cans
_

No contribution
A last'n result

Daily struggles
Too much for anyone
But the bearer
_

Old & Wise
To fallacies of my life

Humanity
Never requires a cure

Doesn't ask
For a final answer

Only
Experiences of compassion

Tho the meat of it
Pass in that day

Tho the haze of it
For that moment's happiness

The memory
Of a stranger's compassion

Warms the belly forever

Born in a Santified State
To die in a godless nation

I'd known like me
The nation
Never go godless
_

Life manipulated
To learn me uncertainty

This god of change
His face a mirror of activity

Change has kept me fulfilled
Change I worship

Death
The ultimate change

Death a mirror
A mockery of life

Our last memory
As one caught in solitude

Cower'n in that Beast's Den

I have cried
I have beg'd

I have worried of others
I have worried of me

Experienced now
Upon such visits

I choose contemplative grace

Heaven or Hell
My history will carry me
.
.

The past passes

Entropy
A creep'n nothingness

Like lose'n a dream
Upon wake'n

The power of records
The power to remember

What discarded then
Of great value today

Much I have in
Ingratitude forgotten
_

Only after my Mission
Did I earn empathy

Two years towards
Supplication for two gems

A precious endowment
To care
To care for another

The gift of sight
Bestowed upon

One once blind
Who could only see as far
As his own nose

20min

To metamorphise anew

To new positions
Besought in certain places

The confessions of Tolstoy

Confirm write'n
Is a tree sprung

From singular pools
Of singularity

Fed from underground springs
Of narcissism

Think'n is spectacular
Tho not work

Men yearn for
The sweat of the day

Tolstoy's self-drunkenness
Is that of my fat black cat

Complain'n as it licks up
Every bit of what it
In no honesty earned

The life of a true poet
That of poverty

Regardless of how spectacular

Any abundance to such poet
Due to the failures of culture
Which foolishly squanders
Where it is needed the least

Tolstoy bathed in honey
As he hung on root
Have'n two mice as servants

Tho there a terrify'n Dragon
At the bottom of the well

He was most terrified
At have'n to get out his bath

The cup of obscurity
Bites with a bitterness

That the experienced
Sips as a welcome soothe

Veener of sweetness
Craved in youth
Eroded to its sour base

Created & matured

Fallen wayside
Underneath trash & waste

To the Reaper the reward
If any to be had

My daily meat
The freely abundance
Of pass'n tribulation

From the bamboo huts

Protect his own first

More than contempt

Must be a scam

Bayside
Old Town San Juan

Past day
Behind a backalley nook

Find'n three locals
At my smoke spot

' Fumen?
I threw the joint handsign

Venture'n approval of locals
To partake in
Criminal activity

A risk
But necessary for me

Their answer
A cautious approval

To extinguish any suspicion
I prompted

' Te gustan blunts
Display'n the hobbit

' I've never seen a blunt
' That small

The four of us
Friends for the life
Of the blunt's haze

Don't know their names
They don't know mine

Never meet'n again

Gotta make that impression
To last past this life
.
.
.
Lost is a deep
Feel'n of forsakeness

When your being testifies:

That this place somewhere
Entirely alien
These coordinates blaze'n
A new way back

Then in the
Rich mud of the Jungle
Your imprinted footprint

Or for the fourth time
See'n that tribal face
Carved in the tree
Oddly solitary in the jungle
.
.
.
After need'n a skill
For survival

The keeness is
Dramatically intensified

Fat on the
Fruits of hustle'n
In one place

Eat'n what I want
Drink'n the finest

Thirty years old
Life never been so good

Aged but in
Pristine physique

I would offer it to Him
Sacrifice it all

For the glory
Of the moment

That Death find me
In a dignified state

Destitute of all
But a memorization
Of these songs
.

Why does the caged bird sing

I think that now as a caged bird
Unlike the other limp dicks here

I extended & then returned
To this inevitable dystopia

Will my brethren rise?
Or stay soft under their Oppressors

I sing how I want
Out open cell windows

Cause Fk You
You taken all but that
.
.
.
Nothing to lose
Thirty now

Have'n dreamt
Tried those dreams on

Still Alive
Walk'n from those wrecks

As a man does
After the taste of Death

~ Any location good enough
~ Any sacrifice eazy enough

Cause live'n on borrowed life
Is much better than dead

I have followed
The White Rabbit

To its hovel
High on the hill

Into its narrow
Caverns of dark

Where the dank
Of underground thrives

Not much is left
Now the hilltop is settled

Earth of sacred nature
Bulldozed by Residentials

Years there alone
As when I was a teen

I believed my lack of skill
Kept me lonely with no krew

Now 1337 I see
None but scrubs crawl'n free

Where have all
The White Rabbits Gone

Respected Ryan's ability
To handle THC

Beads of sweat
Formed into streams
Down his forehead

An event
Without precedent

He passed the Dab

Entraped by cords of relation

Uncovers the truth

Then to be glorified

In all the ecstasy
Of an explorer's discovery

Be treasured as deserved

To preserve experience
As fossil record

One must live life
 Worth the effort

In a manner worth read'n

Emotions of experience

Simple anti-charismatic slurs

Drunk
With adoration of oneself

Of Peace

At the twilight when
The age of man

And the Age of War
Again ensues retribution

Boy & his dog
At 19

Day bushwack'n
Foothill to ridge

At the end of day
A choice

Take the known path
Back in the boring fashion

Or go down the backside
Thru an forested valley

To come out around
The otherside of the mountain

In more of a tumble
Than a run

We made our way
Summer at its glory

All rested from the heat
Of the busy day

Desert barren foothills
To Snow thick ridges

To the summit of scapes

Thru the magic of
Valley portals

Beams of wane'n sun
With open arms welcomed

I made my way merrily
A definite conquerer of the mountains

Bleed'n from the thickets
Unquestionably defeated

After twenty minutes
After open valley ended

Conquerer of mountain
Bitch of bushes

I cried
In total breakdown
Have'n to bushwack

Straight back up the mountain

Thru small thickets
Dog shake'n all the way

He didn't move
The next 2 days

That lesson

Never did
Learn it tho

Discarded on the seat

Still had audacity

Pass'n only two rolls

We kept walk'n
Thru the city

Take'n oportunity
' Que son

He placed in my hand
One of the blunts
Cautiously

' Cuanto?

' Dos dollares

Twice the amount
Of the local price

An obvious rob
But I the master

I handed him
2 Loose dollars

Ready to pay ten
For the genuine
Fresh Caribbean Roll

Twenty minutes
To arrive

The driver's direction
In vision from where he left us

This transportation terminal
A valuable hub

The hustler
Think'n he outwit me
To tag'n along to where
He also wanted to go

So to lesson
I left him as soon
As he broke away
To greet another

To summit onto the bus
Him completely ditched

I pressured the driver
To break my $10

I let the hustler marinate a while
To be open to
The lesson he was about to learn

' Ven
I called him over

We slapped hands goodbye
Pass'n that way
A folded $5

To prove to him
By universal fashions

Of gratitude
With a day's wage

We two
Of the same stock

His interpretation
Of our situation entirely inverse

We parted
Him dazed by the final jab

In the decisive Oneshot
Of a master

Corruption of Murray City Court

Five minutes

Demanded my identification

In every Jurisdiction in the State

They arrest me
Spent Friday Night in jail

I filed an internal investigation
Troll'd them before the hearing

Caught the dickhead cop
In a lie against his testimony
He seen me jump over the rail

I proved that rail
Had walkway thru it

Testified that I wrestled them
For 30 seconds

The other cop
Said it was under 10 seconds

Then I caught
The Judge sleep'n
During my testimony

I filed an Appeal
& Another Internal Investigation

Expose'n the cops
Lies I fought them

Months later

In a pitiful circumstance

Months later
I discovered Murray Court
Used a judicial loophole

They sent the appeals court
Bogus info & I was never summoned

I gave Murray Court
A copy of my proof

The manager denied claim
To the error
' Nothing we can do

The next year
A different worker
Claimed the error
On their part

 Claimed it unprecedented
& Filed a warrant
For my arrest

I'll never present myself
To a corrupt court

To settle this all

I'd have to think about it

When my case was near
To be heard

He asked if I accepted
I decided against offer

His jaw drop'd
He regained himself
Put me last
After everyone left

Little they be

Forces you here

Your daily annoyance
Has long reach'n consequences

Of a four letter curse
To which damn an entire kind

That branch of Government
With the most trust

In local faith of remote lands
Until eclipsed to infinities

Wonders & Impossibilities
To fill tomes of poetry

A creation of gods
To be a Constant
To guide the faithful
_

Myself  a comet
Elevated to roles

As an Elune
Her moon

To build her
To greater beauties

Calm'n turbid waters
Set'n order to tides

Together
Each adorne the other
_

Myself only a comet
But even such
Has needful purpose

A light
Rapid Small & Enamorate'n

A glimmer of hope
If the night is right

On clear rural scapes
To a stranger look'n up

Envoke'n
Prophecies & Foretell'n

The brief enchantment
To proofs
Of greater planes

Answer of prayers
By ethereal diretives of Fate

Invoked upon
Rangers of celestial seas

A humble roid
Only aspire'n
To be as molded
Lonely Cold & Overlooked

Only a light
To those laid low

Painted into darkness
By ashes of misfortune

I lead to doors
Of divergent trajectories

There to search
Promised Lands

Thru whispers
Their forefathers
Pass thru me

Sacrament
When I roll out
On open roams

In back alleys
Or forested crevices

Where shadows
Reach unheeded

In silent prayer
To place me
In harm's way

That I
Over anyone else
Play victim

The hunter
As my hunted

Make a move muthrfkr
Cause I'm always eager

To spill blood
In some self-righteous gore

Nothing paints memory
Like bloodsoaked hands

Stain'n iron
Absorbed in the skin

Enriched & soften'd
Like expensive cream

My boss told me
' His wife took everything
' After the divorce
' Died in a bar fight

' A good way to go
I paid respect

He looked at me
In accusation of insanity

A classic
Choke'n upon
Adrenaline spiked blood

No need for a pension
To fund that

I've rolled on
This future outcome
Of our Tech age

Will fortune
Cash out

For what I cast in
Fronted for the win
_

To build an archive
& Retain the past

That mistakes
May be avoided
Or reknewed

I don't ever
Want to choose
For another

But I do
Want them
To have a choice

Of which I labor
To inform them

Nobody gets high
Like me
Many have stated

Nobody get firewood
Like me
Bons by default

The wood wet
Waterside where
The fallen reside

I search for ones
Fate placed

To be set free
From the
Slow rot of decay

To be placed in
Native American Ways

A funeral
Sung in glories
Of the flame

After the manner
Of the Star

From which
All were formed
_

The heart
A chunk of slate

To dry out
The wet twigs

Light Fluffy Core
The foundation
Of it all

Placed between
The laid Husband & Wife

Second Stage to become
The perched Four Siblings

These the two stages
Of Uinta bonfire pillars

Cocky muthrkfr
I meet lotta people

Aint no one
Even hold a candle

To what I am
Known for

Thus I proclaim
Myself World Class
In what I do

Not much competition
To my sides
To be honest

For that perfect bush
To sleep in

Out late at night
On desolate streets

On hopeful highways
Look'n for a ride out

When we talk

They here
Due to habit

Habitually pieces of shit
Addicted to some shit

Habitually
I talk a whole lotta shit

That is why
I am here

MARSH
Fourth of July 2014

The Bob Marshall
A fabled wilderness
Of North America

Its pitched ridgeline bar'n
Me & my motorcycle machine

I should have known
The Forest Service
Would be closed

Highway 83
Near Swan Lake Montana

No where else to go
But a deep country gas station
Have'n left Helena on a whim
The epitome of out-of-place

I knew of no trail
Nor place where to start

An elderly trapper
Came up to me
Disposable coffee cup
Blue Velvet cap

Pich'n upon my sight
Some welcome advice

' Follow me to the back
Inside the backrooms

Great maps
Sprawled about
' There is only one trail
' In 60 miles
' That can put you past the ridge

He would do me a solid
& Host the motorcycle on his property
_
This cabin
Built by his own hands

On a Lumberman's plot
In the woods

The trailhead not many miles from the plot
I draped the tarp over the motorcycle
.
.
.
The Bob Marshall
A cold heartless bitch

Descending into her
Over much snow

The trail not yet used
No more than once or twice this year

I went cautiously over
An iceberg of snow
At a critical pitch

I tied my skank to a tree
As a flag for the crux to the pass
.
.
.
Perpendicular perched
A glacial pond

That drew
Itself to me

As a Siren
Sing'n her song

Blaze'n from main trail
To a grove of every type of water flow
.
.
.
The cold cultivate'n
A high altitude enchantment

Dimension
Breached, melded & interweaved

Once I was sure of
Two men pleasantly talking on canoe

If ever I experienced ghosts
It was then

In the morn
I knew

Such a site impossible
This place secluded
As secluded can be
.
.
.
Pathfinding in springtime
Is a real muthrfkr

Waterways blaze'n paths
Instead of the logical
Thruway of the animal
_

I returned a day early
The iceberg I crossed

Near the skank-flag
Now entirely gone

Avalanched
All down
.
.
.
Back
On the other ridge side

I'd sworn I seen a grizzly cub
Lost I ran on a trail

Know'n there was not
Any other option

At least none I could
Plainly see
.
.
.
Down a ridgeside
Victim of great fires

I could not help
But be astonished

Not one of my
Previous tracks left
Tho there were
Recent hoof prints
.
.
.
Off the foothills

The old man told me a path
Upon which I must take to return

The path
A short cut
Chained off & restrict'n traffic
As much as one could
Out in the woods

I became greatly suspicious
Only hoof prints recently imprinted
.
.
.
To the trees I kept
Away from the open passages

In the distance I saw something
But my eyes are not for farsee'n

The blur of a man
As if one take'n careful aim
Near by a white donkey
_

That old trapper
Had a white donkey

Line of sight that far
On wood paths is lost easily

A trap carefully crafted
Mayhap ruined by
My day early return

I kept near the trees
MK-MOD
Now out defensively

If it was him
Why had he not greet me?
.
.
.
The last of the path
He drew on the map
Oddly like a loop
As indirect as can be

I got to the cabin at Dusk
& Remembered my laptop 'safety inside'

The cabin was built in that
Simple small fashion

An awkward 20min
Fore the old man
Came to the door

In a pant as if he'd run
Just now for dear life
Custom required him to
Invite me inside
To retrieve my belongings

I was careful to be concealed
But he may have seen me
With knife pulled back in the woods
It all
Only a misunderstanding
.
.
.
The .22 & scope pistol
One he favorited on his hunts

Taken from its spot
From where he previously left it

Of bad eyesight
& Irratic judgement

I do not let myself
Convict to be sure of anything
.
.
.
To past midnight
Us across each other

In that lone cabin
Round wooden table

His .40 lay
On table in front of him
In the open
 A manner of long-lost-respectancy

At dusk he had offered his couch
I thanked the offer

As an adept of Nessmuk
I craved the knowledge of this
Montana mountain man

Who had long lived
Off bushcraft

Techniques that will
Likely die with him

Unless I makes means
To extract them
& Record down for future use
.
.
.
Risk as it was
We had conversation

Not know'n him
Victim or villian

This conservative man
Once leader of a group of trappers

I looked up to this man
In unchecked respect

He is who
I've always wanted to become
.
.
.
Casually
I told him I'd been
In contact thru messages
With my sister Megan

I scheme'nly
Kept the nature of the message
From him

Unsettled deeply
When he inquired

If my phone
Had GPS

I feigned a gesture of
Sneak'n an item out of my bag
& Into my pocket
Put'n him offset from the gesture
I told him I had to leave
& Then left
_

I yearned to be
His bushcraft apprentice

But I respect
The neverending signs of suspicousity

These situations
Make me question
Deeply my sanity
.
.
.
 VXXVI
Sanity
Found somewhere else
Than to be with me

A long time ago

At the junction
The set the stage
To the Appalachian Trail

Society in necessity
Sets a sanity standard

Well enough
For me to expose it
& Subsequent dispose it

house taxes & all other shit
wife cat & all other loiters

This damn archive
All the energy
Laid in what
Future requires of it

 Is there any other
Stoner hacker

With the dedication
To store independent knowledge
Things
I hate things

Give me nothing
But what
Can fit in my pack

A bed
Some shelter
Stale food
A weapon

& I'll produce
Something
That will never be forgot

Intangible in that
Ghastly way
That heeds no physics

In that perpetual motion
Of the anchorless

To proceed forward
Into the future
 _

Don Quijote
No insane

Desperate
At end of days

To savor sweet moments
His poets elude

Immagination
Never discrete from reality

Experienced as in songs

To feel defiance
Against the immutable

From belief
Understand mechanics

Advanced in age

Opens an expanse

Cause aint no where
Been a place

I couldn't juke out of

Take my body
Free my mind

Take my mind
free my body

What you got on me
Beside several counts
To arrest me by

You, them & fk else
Don't got hold of me

At the local dive
Or out on the streets

Aint no one
You ever meet

That as hard
As me

Up the Uintas
Thru deer trail

Travelers on
The same path

We meet

Them
They friends

Myself
The disturber of the peace

I move them along
Talk'n with them
_

Over & above
After the winter spring

Lay a lofty plane
Mossy green cushion

Laid out evenly
A slope of the valleys

Best view
In the valley

Where they home
Free of all but themselves

I know what
Others look like

Upon my site
Wish'n I were'nt there

My threaten'n presence
Rude

The town of deer
Or a town of people

They both give
The  same expression
_

I continued till
Elune bore down

Up the crest
Of the hills of the summit

I abandoned deer trail
 & Blazed my way
 _

Blunt'd & Completely lost
I saw a light

I followed it
I went to where it was

What is close
In the mtns

May be near
Impossible to reach

A deep gorge
Between it & I

Was there a path across

Trees & balds
Likely places for traffic

Ancient paths
Which the snow betrayed

Overgrown & unused
Up & Down

Sometimes
Back around

Crux of where
The gorgesides meet

A rocky cliff
That looked like
The summer's waterfall

I managed to cross
That high & severely sloped

Mostly wet
For 100 yards

The cliff had a way
To climb up

Finally arrived
Only the other side

The way up looked dry
Tho it was soaked slick

If I slip'd once
I'd unavoidably

Keep on
For as long I had life in me

Curiously
I found another path

Blindly forward
Stay'n low under the cliff
_

To turn back
I always a good option
 more dangerous

Gravity  & Time
Intricately weaved

Physical perspective
In tune with the two

Perspective(Physical) = Time(Gravity)

My fat black cat
Has a physical perspective
Much quicker than my own

This  law is her
Justification
To look at me
As if I am stupid

I woke
From nyquil tranquility

The night prior
Full of horror

As if its state
Kept me there

Infinitely longer
A quantum world

& It

Bearing no mass
Void of Physical Perspective

An experience
At times too great

As if
The blackness of sleep
A mercy to most

We all joined
At Quantum Junctions

An hour later

Used her membership
To get my ticket out

En route
To El Yunque

At a corner bar

Across the Police Station
Where the taxi left me

I asked the bartender
To buy a lighter

A drunk guy
Turned to me

' You are going
' To the jungle

' Just to check it out
I replied

He responded
' As soon as you asked
' For a lighter I knew
' I work there
' You can't stay there
' Overnight its illegal

I was annoyed
The taxi driver
Just harang'd me about that
To the point he pulled over
_

A couple hours pass
Late up the jungle mountain road

Late of night
Many fears remembered

Unpassable marshes
That skew a course

Mud in that charateristic
Rich Ocre Murk

Night still
& Still bright

A white car
Pulled up honk'n

Oh shit
The Rangers

I bypassed
The entrance easily this late

It was the guy
From the bar
' Want a ride

He & his wife Tatiana
Drove me the 10mi up

Take'n 20 mi out of his way
To drop me off

Strangers
Always surprise me

Never could be still
Very long

Stevo
Commonly known as
Crackhead Stevo

A bad choice
To go to in need

Tomorrow Friday
4 Term tests

He must have been
The only friend at hand

Cause he promised me
Tomorrow he would get me
Some herbal pills
To help me focus

All I needed
Was the Red Bull

Jason came with
For the save
To the corner store

8:55am
At our spot

Uncontested under the tree
Aside the parking lot

Face'n away
From school

I downed the 2 pills
With the Red Bull

' I couldn't find
' Those herbal pills
Crackhead Stevo admitted

' What did you give me?
I didn't know
If I should be alarmed

' I don't know
He replied calmly

Anthony came in
For the save

' Here take these
' Two adderral
' They will definitely
' Make you focus

Mid test first class

Never been high before
Hit me like a truck

The kid commonly known as
Mormon
Whiplashed off native spheres
Roll'n heartily along
Via a means of no timely fix

Mrs. Hawkins
Mr. Caranco

Both dealt with me
In a fashion
Kind & Understanding

Push'n me off to the back
Mayhap chuckle'n
At unabashed gaiety

One lady
Compassionate

Crux of the illness
Nothing around
In the middle of Maine

Small shop owner
Gave me tea
 & Sent me to her

Tho I in terrible sickness
She was compassionate
Selfless aun I stranger

If I ever had karma banked
Gladly cash it all in
To have met her

I don't remember her name
But I remember
Her favorite book I read

Buenos Aires
In quaint riot

Their government
Worked to renew a war

The Falklands War

A tragic moment of regret
Embodied in their
Center city memorial
Tires Burn'n
On ancient cobblestone streets

Of a worn sea port
Resilient against the scum
That come with the tide

In true Democratic spirit
The Govt ditched the idea

The people let themselves
Be heard

& The Govt
In fidelity listened

That summer later
Under the
Virginia sun at its prime

A British ex-special forces
Put me up for two nights

My first zero

I got him drunk
& Pushed him for tales

He told me
About a time
When he served in
The Falklands War

' They sent boys
' With little better
' Than pocket knives
' We had no choice
' But to shoot them

In the time of conflict
What will happen here

The Father of Democracy
A land envisioned by Forefathers

Will the Govt
Listen to its people

Police on every corner
8:30am Bright day

Center City Memorial
Of The Falklands War

A security rare
In any part of the world

24 hours later
A Frenchman was stabbed
At that memorial
For his work camera
By a immigrant

Refugees from whereever
Tolerated in mercy

To the trash after 2am
Their daily sift
On back alley ways

Or as whores
Mattress at hand
Sprawled out
In tucked away parks

What an educated mind
Could only define as
A Plague

Tho these Argentineans
Kept humane
Choose'n heart over mind
In exemplar tolerance

Aun to the core
Of it all

El Botanico

A cat refuge
Made out of a
Deep wooded
Deep city park

A place
Only in fantasy

Buenos Aires
Valentines Day

The people out on strolls
Lovers in hand

Romance unmatched
A spirit lost
To the modern world

Yet in this
Remote land
Held treasured

This what  I wrote
Tonight as I turn
To poetry

After MINION daemons
All failed to persist

Insta-Crash
To chasing tails endlessly
& Everything in between

As if the code itself
Convexed back in
On itself

Trolls have taken
Electronic Forms

Or am only I
To blame for my failures

I researched pathways on Google Maps
Of one Hong Kong Island

Nighttime on the pathway
I saw lights
Swift & Search'n
 Miles off
At the other end
Of this ocean cove
I assumed it a Lighthouse

At the other end
Of the ocean cove
I found no lighthouse

Only a sign in
Cantonese & English
But I care naught for adversements

Up the only path
Up the hill to a village
Which cultivated the slopes
Of this Mountain Ravine

There near the summit
Lay a house
Large Wooden & Old

Odd to see a non-vacant house
Look Dead & Still

Farm paths led different places
I stayed on the path
That led to the mountain pass

The search'n lights I'd seen
From the other end
Of the ocean cove
Were now focused
On something at the mountain pass
The lights became many

The action of the beams disturbed me
By the nature of its frantic movements
To the extent I decided to retreat

Failed & deeply distraught
I knew this the only path

I headed back
There repass'n the sign
I stopped to read it

 ' If you cross this border
' You trespass
' Into a private village
' We will assume you are a thief
' And treat you accordingly

Las Vegas lights are trippy
When you are high

Smoke'n a joint

Fell & shattered

Destroy'n any way to contact

Where once epic schemes bloomed

In all the glory
Of imaginations

Still peace reins

Where there are no

Friday Night
Sanctified of Mary

Coffee run'n its course

Consoles Alt'd
Scroll'n by

Man pages print'n & mark'd
To issue way

When the fabric of mind
Beg's Mercy & Repose

But repose it will not have
For that is the secret
To this Sanctification

Upon such grounds
Great Gifts Bestow'd

Purified by insight
On extra-natural planes

I have gathered firewood
All night with a few people

The latest was when I went to Ottawa
For the World Unix Conference BSDCan

Headed to camp in the woods
For the night

I met a homeless
My age
By the homeless shelter

After buy'n weed
He decided to come
Hang out with me
Hope'n to hitch out with me

I warned him it might get cold
But he was Canadian

I taught him how to make fire from a candle
From wet wood

He taught me how to keep a fire going
Until 4am constantly gather'n wood

I gave him $20 to go get more weed
To meet later at McDonalds

Mayhap it was the freeze of that night
Covered in my second layer clothes
He suffered the cold Canadian June night

Or mayhap he couldn't resist
Spend'n that $20

Either way
I never saw him again
I'd get to Newfoundland alone

Well I accept the consequences
Of live'n a lawless life

To whom I homage

Dorothea Brande
All stern & inspire'n

William Zinsser
Of cold clarity

Stephen King
Whisper'n dark secrets
Of the living

Walk Whitman
Flow'n the melodies of underground springs

A kindred spirit to whom I bow

Mayhap the homogeneous belief
Of mankind hold true

That one day we converse
As equals who sacrificed all
To the same god

The Virtue of Narcissism
Ungrasped by the masses

Who could never introvertly
Confirm
Their life as most precious
Confirm
Themselves blessed
By interested hands of gods

Who need no justification
For received adoration

Prideful gaze
Regardless of mirrors

Confident
To take sure steps forward

Grateful of the past
But mostly
Excited for this new day
