1am Halloween Night

Russian hacker sent new code

Code I’ve been design’n
Since I began
This arduous adventure
To 1337

I could sleep:

Deprived of it
From hack’n all weekend

I could float:

The auora of this night
Retained a rare spirit
_

One must
For the sake of joy
Stop & partake

Future charge
Always worth the joy of the day
Which can never be had again

One wiley as I
Often escapes such debt
When debtors come call’n
.

.
Reception a curse
Upon adventure

To live life like
A fat cat
Like Tolstoy
What a bile gag

Ode to
The tom cat type
Out for the ruckus
.
.
.
Life is about 
Make’n mistakes
That is where
 Miracles lie
.
.
.
Bad Religion
Longtime muse

Its melody enchant’n me
To higher planes

Born in teenage anarchy
Till late twenties

Out in the
The Northwest Territories

Uttlerly alone
On the planet’s 60th Parallel

Unknown
For thousands of miles

Listen’n to the
True North
