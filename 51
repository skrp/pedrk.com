 LI
Grove Creek
Of the Uinta Mountains

Last days of Autumn

My wife complained
I never let her talk

I countered

We would sit
For great lengths

Afterwhich
You would only say

‘ I love you
_

20min
Of slient peace

The creek in
A pleasant rush

All under
A blanket of leaves

Late October Sun
With elderly gentleness

Clouds heavy
From a summer’s absorbtion

You opened your mouth
To say

‘ I like this place
.
.
.
Friday
Nyquil still on top of me

No coffee
Focus anchorless

Drift’n towards
Same day airfare
_

Ran home at lunch
To tell Ducki

Tonight we fly to
New York City

Lets adventure together
East Coast in Fall

Watson
‘ You sure mark it up a lot
I hope you enjoy the book!

McKusick
‘ Just make sure you read it
May The Source Be With You

I am a FreeBSD fanboy
I study it religiously

30 now

Most of my imaginations
Enacted to all degree

Childhood
For dream’n

Teen
For rampage

Twenties
To test

Thirties
To build
