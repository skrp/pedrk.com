Life is the best thing
Nothing created

Only form'd out of something

Fiction & Imagine'n
Pale to the splendor of Life

What Picture Song or Verse
Compare Aun Reflect
What I see before my eyes

Truth is a candle in the darkness
_

Stories told & Songs said
In the tales during my youth
Always up a tree with a book

Wish'n I were the protagonist
Of some adventure

In a magical wonderland
Or in post-apocalyptic distress

Since my first morn'n out
On the Appalachian
Till now settled for the season

Reflect'n on my life
A story only Life could forge

The beauty & depth
The deepness of space
.

Mexico
Within the first week
The Police Chiefs head
Found in the gutter
& A helicopter shot down

Masked men
With machine guns

Commonplace whether
Grouped in trucks
In packs on motorcycles
Or hidden above in nests
_

Once the neighborhood kids
& Us

Had to take shelter
At the church

The safest building
When that long
Grenade & Bullet War
Blasted on

Blocks from where we ran
.
.
.
Who you walk'n up here
 Like this yours?

This aint your grounds
This my grounds

& If its four vs me
There is always my friend
Who gots my back in my pack
.

The Found’n Fathers
Of America

Would rather Monarchy
If seen our result

Democracy
Humanity’s Betryal

To lie
Hide’n true leaders

Stable & Empowered
Find’n newly elected
Easy prey to schemes
_

Could a King love his people
Honor’n a lifelong bond

Only unfaithful those
Elected for short terms
.
