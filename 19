 XIX
Russians catalogued millions of books
Into a database

It replicated & transported
Via torrent protocol

Most of its mirror'd databanks
Unearthed & Eradicated
But not all


In time I managed
To uncover the treasure
Of its repository
Folded in the deep
_

Months & Months
Turn'n to years
I have dedicated
Towards its acquisition

That this foreign
Yet humanitarian feat

Attain'd to retain
Our species intelligence

Be not lost
Due to tyrants & their greed
.
.
.
Deep in the Jamaican Blue Mountains
Thru the twisty narrow
Red dirt road

Christina & I roamed
The landlady's dog
Trail'n at our heels

The mutt displayed
Vivaciousness & Worth
Chase'n off cars

‘ Richie we got to stop it
‘ It will get hit!

I reply annoyed
But mathematically

‘ Christina
‘ The dog lives on this road
‘ What are the chances

‘ That of all the days
‘ Today it will get hit?

We had to return
The landlady her dog
Bloody & missing a toe
.
