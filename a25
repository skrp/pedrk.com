At a beautiful site
Twix two creeks cross

I settled for the night

The rains after midnight
Left me the hard choice

To try sleep'n soak’d

Or continue to the shelter
7mi away

30mi in one day
There to sleep dry
_

I decided
The only rest would be ahead

As soon as I packed
My headlight flickered
Then went out

Stand’n there shock’d
Clutch’n the Hiker Biker II

Ghost’s words
Came to mind

This was the true trial
Happenstance lined
To forge me a man
V
V
v
Tight paths
Thru dense wood

Trail only marked
By the light flicker’n

Whenever Elune bore her face
Upon puddles
Left by imprints of trail

Hours in the
Misery of rain

Too miserable
To take off my pack
& Stash my tent
Swollen with water
In my arms all night

Hours in the
Eerie deep night fog

Amoung dark ferns
& Celestial canopy

At times crawl’n
At times circl’n

Always just hope’n
To see that geometric shape
Of manmade shelter

Harshly outlined from the scenery

I had no map
Only the promise of that one sign

The Weak Haze of Morn
Broke the void of night

Finally a sign bore witness
The next shelter 
Was 8mi ahead

In the night
I missed the shelter

I set up the tent
That I in misery carried

Sleep'n dank
As 6am hit

Only to rise
In the late morn
& See 50 yards away

The shelter I had so hopefully sought
V
