I know the fear
Of mountain travel

Under Elune
Bright in deep night

Alone
Hear'n the distant chant'n
Of fanatics
In religious embodiment

Dense fog
Confirmed late tranquility
Yet echoes arouse’d many fears

500mi 
In less than a month

Celebrate'n at Wise
Write'n for hours

I accomplished a true feat
The day was mine

Fire a temporary maiden
Demand’n more & more

Return'n cherished 
Expressions of passion

Like ancient 
Sirens of the Sea

From devoted service
She returns
Warmth & Bombasticity

Know'n to neglect
Would turn cold

That blind'n blaze of
Heat from her heart

What is best
To be cooked against
The roast of fire?

Pepperoni

Sliced thick as steak
Spear'd upon a twig

Crisp against the 
Heat of blaze

It's warm juices
Sing savory songs
In sizzel'n slurs

Taste'n you find
That tho most food
Be hampered by outdoors

This meat
Is only ever brought
To its height here

Of all places
A fire-monger such as I
Prefers the discard'd lot

Wild & Untame Grounds
Found tucked away

At one such place
I sizzeled pepperoni

Smoke'n a joint
All set up for the night

Past midnight
Write'n by blaze

Went to service
My temporary maiden

Gather'n wood in the dark
I noticed the stumps
Fell'd & rot’d trees

Shred from bears
Feed'n on grubs
Nest'd in the rotten wood

I then understood
Why years
Had covered this ground
