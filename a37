Back at the trail
Post powwow with strangers

I decide to hitch back
To Zach

40mi later
I discovered him gone

At camp
I discover'd only a note

Written from the sign
He used to hitch
In broad black Sharpie 

Have'n taken the 
Considerable risk 
Stop'n the driver 
Leaveâ€™n the vehicle
To leave me it

' I got a ride
' Maybe we'll meet
' Further up the interstate

Get'n back to the trail
Again
Was a real muthrfkr

A black lady at the 
Boys & Girls Club
Scowled a man into 
Give'n me a ride
Out of the danger 
Of that hood
