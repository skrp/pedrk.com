Tiffany Sowers

The Blonde Punk from Harrisburg
Would host us in Duncanon

My sister did not get lost
On the complicated path

I spent much time search’n 
For each next blaze 

The Blaze
A symbol that all was right
In its place

Normal life 
Is an odd thing 
After months in the woods

At a club with Tiffany’s friends

Them ride’n bulls
& Booty Bump’n

Have’n myself 
Woken on the forest floor

The experience was entirely unnatural

Tiffany you are True Punk
In a sea of posers

You & I something special
But you had a boyfriend

Friendship is selfless
Sexuality is selfish

Exos

A pack
Designed for 
One like me

Lightweight

Adjustable

Within one week
Christina’s Merrill Vibrams
Were torn to shreds

In Pennsylvania
‘ The rocks massage your feet
