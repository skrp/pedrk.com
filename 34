Hell
I know what Front'n is

Street kid
From dangerous streets

Hell I been
In plenty of situations
& If I'm Front'n up to you

You will know it
.
.
.
Scum & Trash
Those are who I meet
On the streets

Roanoke offered me refuge
After the cataclysmic storm hit

Met people thru people
I was with people I'd met
From those people after that

Power been out for weeks
That crazy-muther-fkr
Who hosted me
Traded internet for bud

Maybe it was that bowl
But I do know
He was one crazy-muther-fkr

I peace'd out of there
A bit past midnight

In the center of the city
Jam'n to Die Antwoord

Someone call'd me out
From behind

From the bush that skirt
A grassy hill

Burst out a large man
Toward me
Face full of tats

â€˜ You travel'n too?
He offered friendly gather'n
To his camp at the hillcrest

Zach & I hung out
All night on that foothill

Hell I didn't have
Anywhere else to go
But right here

We trade'd stories of adventure
But he trump'd me de facto
Once he killed a guy
With a pipe

That short time was of friendship
& Shared mutual respect

Now I ain't say'n Zach wasn't Scum
But he definitely ain't Trash
