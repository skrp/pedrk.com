Treacherous leaves 
Litter the ground

Especially important parts
Holes dips or deep-water

The rhythm of the trail
If the primary guide
Will keep you safe

Loved to tinker & play
A man after my own heart

The white storm of winter
On & On

Vomit’n out in the cold
 
No medicine 
To stay the fever

Each day of suffer’n
Many times reduced from slow step
Into a crawl

Forward automatic when
There is no retreat

Caught in a route
Know’n to stop
Meant a true end

In such conditions
One is able to see
Many hidden doors
