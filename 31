 XXXI
Rampage
Second to nothing
Of all we hold dear
The ring of that havoc
True & Forever


North Beach Corpus Christi
Remote places are desolate
At night

The stillness of night
Carries true that deep ring
Of havoc

Barclay Jason & I
Roam'd our stomp'n ground
Look'n for something to stomp

3 Hoodlums travel’d
To our city
 A hood from the North

Look'n for what troublemakers look for
There find'n us

Temporary & Complementary
Were the forces that created our unique body

Like the combustion of celestial bodies
To form planets
Or destroy them in magnificence
_

North Beach Corpus Christi
 Like playgrounds lay abandoned zones

Mini-Golf Courses
Funhouses
Go-Cart Tracks

Aun commercial zones were violated

Upon Resort Roofs
City Aquarium
Work Zones

There Find'n & Take'n
Fire Extingquishers
Keys from Bulldozers
Change from Fountains

Leap'n off 20ft dunes to sand
Soft & Cool
Spray'n Extinguisher thru forsaken halls
Rummage'n up a rukus

Our verbs of havoc
Carried us
Paragraph upon paragraph
On the page of Night

Till Late or Early
Depend'n on if you slept or not
Our twin trio set our depart

Back at our campground
In the marsh
Behind Jason's house we found

The homeless live'n
At those parts
Dine’d on our poptarts
& Warm'd by our fire
