I studied poverty
From teen to adult

Conclude’n always
Some things in life
Can’t change

Submit’n to passivity
Against child man or elderly

Eat’n cactus raw

Pick’n stray stale pasta
Loose from torn garbage bag

Chase’n Dorito crumbs
Sift’n thru trash cans
_

No contribution
A last’n result

Daily struggles
Too much for anyone
But the bearer
_

Old & Wise
To fallacies of my life

Humanity
Never requires a cure

Doesn’t ask
For a final answer

Only
Experiences of compassion

Tho the meat of it
Pass in that day

Tho the haze of it
For that moment’s happiness

The memory
Of a stranger’s compassion

Warms the belly forever
.

Shell
Workbench of simplicity

All with
Input & Output

Each part
Do’n one thing well

Pipe’d to produce
Certain expectations

< > , | , $( ) , { }
${i%/} , (( ))

Iterations & Conditionals
Diagnostics & Parallelism

Unix enviornments
Are boundless playgrounds
.
.
.
Life is best lived simply
If somewhere aint good
Go somewhere else
.
.
.
Pick a spot on the globe
& Reach it

That is the power
Of an adventurer
