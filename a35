B-Rad

The twin’s 
Scooter mechanic

He juked the rich kid
Into the bill for the buffet 

We had fun & got wrqd
People may have came or went

Bunch of guys 
Dive'n into the lake

Filmed in
What About Bob

Drunk Stoned & Free
In Virginia Spirit

At B-Rads

The power from the storm 
Left the city with sparse power

B-Rad traded bud for internet
To his dealer

He hustled one of his friends
Into buy'n the fine steaks
He cooked for us to eat

B-Rad's friends 
Are only temporary associates

B-Rad got wild
The trail was call'n me back

I gave my adios
Then walked into the 
Roanoke Midnight

v
Cities are shady 
Past midnight

On the outskirts of downtown
I walked listen'n to 
Die Antwoord

 Someone called me out from behind
Took out my earbuds & turn’d around

A large man 
Face full of tats

Charged towards me 
In a hurry

I froze like a fawn
Know’n I was already dead

Relief hit his face
As we meet

' Hey I'm travel'n too
' You want to stay with me
‘ My camp is up that hill 

I didn't have 
Anywhere else to go

Tho I kept my knife
At ready

The strength of my little
CRT Peck

It is easily hidden
In the palms

Zach & I 
Rest’n upon the grassy hill 
Against our packs
Over-look'n Downtown

Nights on the street
Are times of wakefulness

Under the Sun
Sleep is much safer

The moon spent
Brag'n & Boast'n
As men do in polite manners

‘ Once a crackhead tried to 
‘ Rape my girlfriend 
‘ I beat him to death 
‘ With a iron pipe

He won with that story
