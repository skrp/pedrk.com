The earth my mattress
The heavens my ceiling
The moon my light

My boot
The pillow upon which
I rest my weary head

A peaceful mind
With a simple life

Go'n where I care to go
Stop'n where I care to stop

My only relationship
With the sky & her dramatics

The large expanse
Cares not for my issues

Why should I care for hers?

But as she becomes
Burdened with troubles
So do I

Unable to counsel
Only Listen & Feel

I suffer her tears
I endure to her cry
.
.
.
If Life is hell
But Hell is worse

Then why do you
Now feel so terse?

An email to you my favorite
Deviant Art Artist

nicktheartisticfreak

I am very happy that you would depict my prose
I have changed the project from pedrk.com

My present life would suit best
To be memorialized

Tho I have done great deeds
Of some
Stories told & songs writ
[ autobiographical of course ]

I can deny not
That my present life

Suits me best
To Boast & Brag

Enter the master bedroom
In my redneck cousin's house

You take in my
7ft steel unix server

Modular & variant
Are the levels

That compose this tank
Of an archive

You are told this archive
Has substantially
More terabytes of valuable data

Than of any known across
Defcon
vBSDcon
ZFSdev.summit

You like the orange Osprey pack
Affectionately hook'd on top

Stained by thousands
Of miles of mountain

‘ Sun to the right
‘ Till it never set

You walk around the machine & experience
1337 Hi-Tech
Hacker command center

All black devices emanating
A Razer green light

You count
4-monitors  3-keyboards
8-*puters  10-external drives
Beautifully assembled

cli til def!
BSD 4 Life
Anarchy on the NET

Will you describe that?
In that Hypersexual
Violent & Macabre fashion
Of the pieces
You have long displayed
