 XXII
The day the Lacandonians
Kicked me out of their jungle

I returned to the nearest city
Beat down & depressed

Cancun
Several states away

Yet the girl I'd met there
More than a week prior
Was not 10 blocks away

Around 10pm
 She showed up drunk

Drink'n the clear liquid
As natural as water

' Come with me to my hut
‘ In the jungle
‘ I'll take you where
 ‘ There are mango trees
‘ Stay with me tonight

She told me with those
Big beautiful bloodshot eyes

I said my goodbyes to the hostel
To a bed that I'd never sleep in

From that moment on
I began my adventure with
La Chilanga
.
.
.
The primal breadth in me searches
Towards that open roam
To that free forage
Done in its own time & pace

The natural world offers freely
The simple answer to Harmony

Who can reject
The face of this truth

Plain as the sun
It confirms the soul

Observe’n the wild where
Each Species Different & Compete'n

Accept their place
Respect no master
.
.
.
I'd lost my chance
To befriend wild monkeys

Like how I'd been unable to befriend
The adolescent bears of the Appalachians

They always ran
Tho I chased them
Call’n sweetly with treats
.
.
.
 My weapons
Are of the Elite Grade
MK-3 MOD 0 is no exception

Undercover & Accessible
Out on the road

In my pack
 Hitch'n or Cruise'n

Once at a park
South of Calgary

Where the flood has destroyed half the town
Pump’n out the contents of the sewers

A cop kicked me up
Look'n for a felon

I went easily back to sleep
A Scout is always prepared

 Consequences if assault'd
She would deliver with cruelty
.
.
.
I have gathered firewood
Thru the entire night
With a selected few

Out in the cold June forest
Past midnight in the
Parc de la Gatineau

The pit at the summit
Of roll’n wilderness

The homeless stranger & I
Search’d desperately
For firewood all night

Night a terrible cold
Like only Canada knows
.
.
.
Ottawa at dusk for the
World Unix Conference
BSDcan

Guzzel’n brews at the
Royal Oak
Ramble’n on BSD over ZFS

Leave’n early to find
Some untame ground

Past the outskirts
Of the Capital of Canada
_

‘ I can walk with you
‘ And show you the way
A UoO student got off his bike
To walk with me 15 min

Tho I merely asked
The name of the street
Always glad for company

His parents the
Classic Canadian Arizona Snowbirds

He advised I revise my plan
‘ Parc de la Gatineau
‘ Will be more gauranteed
_

20min down the path
‘ Utah!

Someone called out back

 ‘ There are free maps
‘ I brought one for you
‘ Didn’t want you to get lost
‘ On my account

Canadian winters
Cultivate a people
Sensitive to the core
.
