Life is something
That comes & goes

& At the end
I hope like

Pheonix I fly
All flame & sudden glory

Then the darkness
Of the night
.
.
.
'Fuck the world
I'd first seen this sentence

On my wife's chinese shirt
Fate's message

My catch phrase now
'Fuck the world

'Fk the world
'How did I mess
'It all up again
Often sentiment
That goes with
My excited smirk
Mania & Lust

Out there
In the world alone

That is what
I am best at
.
.
.
Didn't belong anywhere
Bury me best right here

Event at the apex
Life horizons death

Faith
Where I die sacred
.
.
.
