Life is something
That comes & goes

& At the end
I hope like

Pheonix I fly
All flame & sudden glory

Then the darkness
Of the night
_

'Fuck the world
I'd first seen this sentence

On my wife's chinese shirt
Fate's message

My catch phrase now
'Fuck the world

'Fk the world
'How did I mess
'It all up again
Often sentiment
That goes with
My excited smirk
Mania & Lust

Out there
In the world alone

That is what
I am best at

Let youth
Give me the momentum

To fly

Didn't belong anywhere
Bury me best right here

Event at the apex
Life horizons death

Faith
Where I die sacred

It is death
That tells

A man's Tale
.
.
.
Like my Mission
Like my Appalachian Trail

Never once believed
I'd make the end

Now with all false faith
Stripped of me

Failure
Is the sound
Of Nothing

When my words
Are distributed abundantly
.
.
.
