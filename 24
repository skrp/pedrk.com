Yesterday
I woke in a fit of compulsion
By 7am my pack was ready

A certain day of the year inspires me

I took the train to its
End-of-the-line
North to Ogden

After consult'n
With the local homeless
I found the spot to hitchhike North

Today
There was only one canyon
Between me & Helena
After 5 hours I became defeated


A rickity car pulled over
I shoved my heap of things
Into the back seat with me

They were a couple in their early 30's
Who offered me drink
Of clear liquid
From a Sprite bottle
That I declined

Further down the road
I repack'd the pile into my bag

The man drive’n
Commented wrily

‘ You won't be needing
‘ To worry about that soon

I tensed at the comment
They laughed in that lofty
Too High To Give a Fuck tone


Slowly I realized
As the car began
Careless drifts

The situation was entirely different
From what I had suspected

I released the grip of my blade
That was tuck'd out-of-sight
But never out-of-reach


The car began
More dramatic swerves
Enter’n the canyon

From the outer edge of one side
To the outer edge of the other

On this two lane highway
Northwards Butte to Helena

Our velocity a constant 80 mph

Each turn a hope for death
But never
With commitment to end

Typical of
Passive Hippie Pussies


It was thirty miles
Of canyon twists

Before the police
Chased us down

Faced to make the choice
The weak caved
_

Death has always been
A familiar face

But it was this
Long & intimate dance
That won my love


A true Celebration
of my birthday

I was alive
But born again
.

Ferry Ride
All night to Newfoundland

Out on deck
Closest to the ocean

Rumor told
‘ Gros Morne
‘ Remnant of the Applachians

Providence Unfold’n
The next day hitch’n

The five rides
Like fate brought me

Up those bogs
Of Gros Morn
I felt I walked
With an ancient Native

Feed’n the animals
Understand’n a different way

Three days to travel
For one night
Three days to return
_

In Benos Aires
I stayed a month with a cult

That allowed spirits to dance
All night in their bodies

I wouldn’t deny
Such understand’n
.
.
.
I live a lawless life

Far or Near
Govt reigns supreme

Beast or Man
No earth to be free

An omnipresent foe
Heretorefore unimagineable

Fear can not stop me
That at risk
Worth much more than mere life
