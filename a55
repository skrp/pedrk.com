Camp’n hidden
Is a double-edged deal

Less likely seen 
Is less likely helped

Sleep’n in the open maybe best
Hours 4am – noon

Downtowns are meccas for crackheads
Crawl’n around any hour

Find areas with no reason
To attract people

Industrial Areas, Churches, Fields

Only sleep near trees
People are often run over

If headlights shine on you
The driver can see you

Any location can be
Run’n grounds for some type
Be prepared readily with a weapon

Scattered dry twigs
Will alert you
