 VXXVI
Sanity
Found somewhere else
Than to be with me

A long time ago

At the junction
The set the stage
To the Appalachian Trail

Society in necessity
Sets a sanity standard

Well enough
For me to expose it
& Subsequent dispose it

house taxes & all other shit
wife cat & all other loiters

This damn archive
All the energy 
Laid in what 
Future requires of it

 Is there any other
Stoner hacker 

With the dedication
To store independent knowledge
Things
I hate things

Give me nothing
But what 
Can fit in my pack

A bed
Some shelter
Stale food
A weapon

& I'll produce
Something 
That will never be forgot

Intangible in that
Ghastly way
That heeds no physics

In that perpetual motion
Of the anchorless

To proceed forward
Into the future
 _

Don Quijote 
No insane

Desperate
At end of days

To savor sweet moments
His poets elude

Immagination
Never discrete from reality

Tho the meat of it
Experienced as in songs

To feel defiance
Against the immutable

From belief
Understand mechanics
.
.
.
Those reckless
Advanced in age

60+
White-haired

Heroes
Billy to the youth

Future
Under such terms

A blank white page
As if hair
Opens an expanse
To handle whatever
.
.
.
I don't give a fk

Cause aint no where
Been a place

I couldn't juke out of

Take my body
Free my mind

Take my mind
free my body

What you got on me
Beside several counts
To arrest me by

You, them & fk else
Don't got hold of me

At the local dive
Or out on the streets

Aint no one
You ever meet

That as hard
As me

punk'n cops
us packs on motorcycles
or as myself
go'n too fast
cops just give up
.
.
.
To tax land
Is to own land

Leave all else
In lease
_

Govts of the world
Take away

Ancestral lineage
In that fashion
