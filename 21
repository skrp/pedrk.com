I once met a witch
One hot summer in Mexico

Her abode
Uncannily cold upon our arrival

By the time we took our leave
The temperature would oddly normalize
Back into a noonday oven

With her mother
They would dig up the dead

To enchant the body parts
& Bind the unfortunate souls

To reveal ancient wealth
Or conspire them into curses
_

Witchcraft was rampant
As well as the worship of
La Santa Muerte

I ventured there
To preach & teach

Two long years of righteousness
& Chaste workings

Odd
Years later it was I
Who had been converted

To the only scientific god
' The bringer of true Peace
_

All your children are equal
You will visit me
I will see your face

May my death be quick
& The Peace-of-Nothingness everlasting
Viva La Santa Muerte
