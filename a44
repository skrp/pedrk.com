Night Hikes
Suffused with
Calls Screeches & Wails

Eyes flicker'n 
Out in the distance
Green Yellow or Orange

Bear scat fresh tonight
Headed same direction

Weed & Energy-JellyBeans
Pushed me onwards

One terrible shriek 
Tore thru any ever heard

As if from 
A baby torn to shreds

Headphones allowed me
Ignorance to continue

At the top of a ridge
Of rocky views

Cowboy camp'd aside
The edge of a cliff

My pen fell 
Down into its misty depths

Howl'n winds 
Shook me all night

If I woke
Feel’n as if fall’n
Off a cliff

Tonight it would be true
But it would be quick

Purpose always reveals itself
To the pure of heart
& Vigorous of mind

My reality 
A childhood fantasy
_

My family
Know'n my distress

Need'n to wish me well
Drove 60mi
To the airport

On hopes to find me
Not know'n the when 
Only the where

Sweetly I savor the shock
Of that memory

Hear'n my named called out
In the Salt Lake City Airport

Only by fate 
They had found me

The Edification Movement is Nigh

The Priest 
Sacrifice'n sex for purity

The Student 
Sacrifice'n excitement for intelligence

The Bookwork 
Sacrifice'n ease for depth

The Traveller 
Sacrifice'n funds for experience

To toil for 
Higher states of being

Strung out on the tune of Meth

Too many hear your wretched verse
Too many are damned by its wretched curse
