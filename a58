hristina entered the Trail
Carlisle on Highway 11

One must understand
The flow of the Path

Best taught to senses
Other than sight

Christina
Was taught night hike’n

First night on the trail

Fog thick & lowly
Her traverse’n lonely

Have’n at dusk
Chased a Pooh

She spent sleep 
Fend’n off porcupines

2yr olds are Poohs
2-3ft have’n no Fathers

Elders all killed 
The year before last

They get by 
In a haze of
Ignorant bliss

Unintelligent of the
Environment around them

I’d been try’n 
To befriend one

We would
Make good friends
