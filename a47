1000mi path
A lifelong wish

In 3mo I read
The Lord of the Rings
At age 11 

I've always been akin 
To the adventure of walks

Since a child 
Too wild for home
Out on streets 
On the long roam

Past govt fences
Favor’n desolate places
.

Bear's Den

Its stone structure 
Spoke words of wisdom 

Against the shoddy 
Frame structures of today

Despite human intrusion
The woods were at peace

Moss clung to it with affection
Birds call it home
_

To enter the building
One had to answer
A thru hikers riddle

Proven true
The machine allow'd me inside
V

Sweet were the spoils
Raid'n that hostel alone

MoHo Fig-Newtons PB Internet!

A man asked where the owner was
He was with the Tree-Removal

I told him I had no idea

' I am from a group
' We have land where we keep 
‘ All-things-in-common

' Would you like to stay 
‘ With us for a while?

' You would have a free
‘ Place to stay & eat
' If you work your part

Cults always interest me
I helped them with the rest
Of the jobs for the day

We headed out to Sabbath 
On Hillsboro
