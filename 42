 XXXXII

Woes of failure against
Man Beast Machine

Cries to echo
Throughout the halls
Of my internal being

Mathmatical waves
Breach the horrors
Of infinities
_

My core 
Deep-seated dream
Sits cast the desire to
Live off the land

In the Selway Wildreness
Grouse critter like vermin

In good position
Starve'n
I took aim & fired

The bird burst
Like a balloon of feathers

Instead of continue'n ahead
It juke'd backwards alive
Down the ravine

I unsheathed the knife
Laid down the rifle 

& Chased it into the bramble
Until enraged & ashamed 

I was forced to concede defeat
Outsmarted by a Grouse

Also seriously injured
From sprung knee
_

Failure is the pain
To accept

What you dreamt
Wasn't suited for you

The life of beasts 
Free of our system of captivity

Much more
Precious to me
.
.
.
Canadians cultivate cities
Buildings Parks Artworks

Bypassed
Indifferently by me

Not cause
I have seen much

Not cause
I have seen better

Alone

In a world
Built for two

Geometric expressions
Materialized by souls
 
Crafted thru double lenses
Of companionship

Upon my single lens
 
Details Meanings Symbols
Bypass entirely alien
