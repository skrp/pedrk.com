El Botanico

A cat refuge
Made out of a
Deep wooded
Deep city park

A place
Only in fantasy

Much can be derived
From this society

Buenos Aires
Valentines Day

The people stroll'n
Lovers in hand

Romance unmatched
A spirit lost
To the modern world

Yet in this
Remote land
Held treasured
.
.
.
I have gathered firewood
All night with a few people

The latest was when I went to Ottawa
For the World Unix Conference BSDCan

Headed to camp in the woods
For the night

I met a homeless
My age
By the homeless shelter

After buy'n weed
He decided to come
Hang out with me
Hope'n to hitch out with me

I warned him it might get cold
But he was Canadian

I taught him how to make fire from a candle
From wet wood

He taught me how to keep a fire going
Until 4am constantly gather'n wood

I gave him $20 to go get more weed
To meet later at McDonalds

Mayhap it was the freeze of that night
Covered in my second layer clothes
He suffered the cold Canadian June night

Or mayhap he couldn't resist
Spend'n that $20

Either way
I never saw him again
I'd get to Newfoundland alone
.
.
.
If the govt is mad at me
Well I accept the consequences
Of live'n a lawless life

It is a part of me
I wish never taken away

Tho I may at times take liberty
In the freedom of my wishes
.
.
.

Dazed & exhausted
From the long haul

When vacation
Is the exact opposite

Now back to the grind
Find it a rest

As the level ground
Is rest from mountain elevations
.
.
.
Most these muthrfkrs
I interact with

Can't fathom
The man I am

Tie'd out
Money at the brim

I just hope
They aren't blind

Cause my eye
Punk out garanteed

Perfected since
I was hardly a teen
.
.
.

The drunk guy
At the local dive

Talked a bit
Of shit

But I found it
Quite the complement

' Dark mysterious stranger
' In the corner

I just gave him
My look

Texans
Never tolerate disrespect
.
.
.
Not a holic
To anything in life

Mayhap
Only the pleasure

Of take'n in
The moment
As if it the last

Peaceful
Is the heart
That die fulfilled
.

Friends & Love
Can be lost long
But will always return
To those who seek

Of all I meet
Not till I returned home
Did I find

Kindred
Sprinkled by Destiny

To waypoints
Of how one should be
_

Many songs writ
& Stories told
Of my deeds

Elijah my closest cousin
His deeds
Only told in first person

Which are equal
In comparison
To my own

How is it
That in my long seek
I find you again

Alone as when
I was a child
Now alone
As an adult
Back home
_

I always disrespected my dad
He would say he was the shit
But he only ever rolled with family

I thought that
The lamest fault of all
Teen in my social height
_

Now with fewer friends
But still friends

Elijah was the only one
I still cared to see

We talked
As I haven't for unknown years
About the same topics
I'd shame my dad for do'n
_

Old age
I know now

Is learn'n
Your dad was right all along
& You played the fool
.

Cuban cigar
Sized blunt

31st Birthday
Hot boxed
With JJ & Elijah

I choked out first
Break'n to chicken
As I rolled down my window

The smoke
A giant cloud
Deompress'n

Over the houses
& To the sky
_

Codine coated blunts
Put me to shame
Tap'n out

Back to back blunts
Put me to shame
Tap'n out

Back to the streets
For my birthday
& I got played the pussy
.
.
.
Wife & I
At different
Strengths & Weakness

Under pressure but
Took me off the mountain

In admiration I said
' I would have
' Flip'd the fk out
' Fk you, fk this, fk everything

She replied
' I work better
' Under pressure

Her research paper due
That night

' Send over what you have
' & I'll help you
I told her in grattitude

I opened her email
It only contained
The teacher's prompt
.

Die Hard 4

If you gonna be 1337
Be loud mouthed

& One day
Some Bruce Willis muthrfkr

Bust in to say
' Let's save the universe

& I'd know
I prepared all my life

Batman knows
Robins
Know their place

A ride to die
Kind of muthrfkr

This wave
Till its end

In hopeful
Total Washout
.
.
.
All I need
One look
One memory

Then they know
Muthrfkr cast
Apart from the rest

Your reaction
A tired route
Tho to you
Unique it seem

Off the wall
Blackest of sheep

Lucifer to gods

Try to understand
I'll laugh at your tumble

White razed black
Latin grown Mexican

American at the core
Not that fat phone type

Southern raised
& Never tolerant
When some muthrkfkn
Northerner think they shit

Fk this federation
Rember the cause

Rebel against
Two Faced Tyrants

Minorities proclaimed free
Tho cuffed they ever be

Not for
Womanize'n

For ball'n over
Weak

You down
Cause you want to be

I up
Thats where

.

Approach'n fear
Fk that

I do what I do
But  never what I'm scared to doo

Shit I been against
Many things I done

But shit its proof
No Fear
After it is done

My first
High school friend
Anothny
' El Feo
As say his family

He & Benny
Us all watch'n
Pulp Fiction

My mom bust in
At the start
Of the ass rape'n

My mother see
Aun Snuff
To me
Know as 'Disney'
The only high schooler
Only allowed to watch 'G'

I could a
Explain'n this an actual movie

Fear fk that
Rather their speculative eyes

At us in 10s
Rise'n from the live'n room floor
Past 10 skip'n school

Never a single female

Those seniors you

Offer'n to cruise
Skip'n school to roll

Northside
The side where we
Can only ever be

So if you aint black
Or those visit'n people
Its too aparent

Pull with their
Old grandmother
Holds strong there
.
.
.
Never disrespect me

Texan
Or Narcissism

I'm gonna call you out
To deal undiscolsed bargins

Cause I'm old
Too old

The best day
To come is Today

Call'd out a muthrkfr
In a mexican bar
Defiant against a nest

Sure as shit
I'm call you out

Your bitch
Cum think'n of me

If she ever sees me
Thats just
Who I be

Not handsome
Manly

Cause she know
Imma fk her-
Like my last

Only to my wife
Like every night

Teach'n these
Slovenians

At their bar
They say
' All we got is AKs
' Not good for long distance

I laugh
' All I care about
' Is whats in front
' Of me up to that railway
( 30 feet)

' Revolvers are best
' Cause you know
' All you got to do
' Keep on that trigger

Shit those
Are'nt meant for reload'n

' But if you expect
' To use more than 5
' You ain't live'n
' Much longer anyway

Americans always
Know their guns

Homeless
To baller

Not have'n excess
But ball'n with
What is given

There the alchemey
Of Midas touch

Life sweet
In American Saturation

Ball'n
But in reality
Give'n back
To the streets

I know the joy
Of a big tip
& If I can do that
I will

The jackass to most
But value overrides

24
Life to up in Arson

Nothing but what
In my pack

None
Not even me
Know what part
Of the states I'm in

No cell
Only a CERT

My back
Guarded only ever
By my arms

Tom cat
From society

Money thrown at me
Cause they know

I know wassup

I throw it back
At the ones I like

Money
Aint shit to me

Where you can
Blunt back to back

If I'd known
My siloette at 31
V & Curvy
In prime state

Old age
Might not have
Become the monster
It is to me now

Shit pants
Happens in adventure

But back out
Unable without assistance

Deserves
The death that comes

But not all
Get what they deserve

Some streched
To torment

Faith
Keeps my chin up

The weight
Of the legacy
Of my past
will secure

Farewell Blazed
In glory of the moment

Light of Heart
To see Truth
.

Virtual Reality
The realm of gaming

To experience existence
As one wishes

As a female
Nightelf champion

I teased
Christina's boyfriend
That he played a girl

He replied
' I'd rather
' Stare at her
' Ass all day

I always
Carried a briefcase
In high school

Cutoff Jincos
& Colored mismatch socks

Colored hair
& Noose wallet rope

In the black school
Northside Hillcrest

I always
Ride to die

On those razor
Edge life styles

Life writes stories
As vivid as pain

In that
Complex & Incomprehenisble Way

Those who ever
Crossed me
Lived in anxiety

Those who ever
Accepted my friendship
Meet me in happiness

They knew I was
A certain kind of
Muthrfkr
Tho garanteed not
The treacherous kind

In any
Social sect

I have explicitly
Been taken in
As a rare oddity

Too blinded by interest
Too see my
Blatant anti-qualities
.
.
.
Cultivated
Perpedicular to society

Adventure unfamiliar
In a net

Words outshined
By the glare

Hackers
Clicked away
_

Against the grain
Black sheep

Often I suspect
This my only motive

Or that it be
Excellence when unguided

Many paths
Numerous choices

Where whim meets wisdom
Subconcious instincts unearthed

Alone
Cleanroom

The reaction pure
Wastes of reaction

In that earthly circle
Action feeds another

Off what is
Left unused

To be always as able
But never squandered
.
.
.
Codine coated blunts
Never again please

Spliffs only smoked
When I forget how much
I dislike them

I enjoy saturation
Of one thing alone
.
.
.
Time precious
Statis maddening

Give me the
Liberty of meaning

To cause movement
On the roll of life

Restrict me
In a space of no progress

Mutex Locked
Waiting that seems forever
.
.
.
Alone
For the first day
Of a month

Doing
What I always do
I guess I love my life
.
.
.
Losers
Rejected by all

Those
My people

Us taken each
As an other

Know'n the
Other is
Okay with what

Not fake'n
It along
With the rest

This is
My legend
No delays

You serve the story
Or we go our seperate ways

Not selfish
Understand'n
Earthly ways

Forced
Execrements shit
Only flies like
.

Not the man
Of my city

That time passed

Ranger
Off the grid

In forgien lands
Full of fear

First time
O'r The Atlantic

Never heard
Of the city before
Vienna

Austria
Think'n they spoke Austrian
The entire time

Slovenia
Made me realize
I knew nothing of Europe
When I seen
It existed on a map

Ljublejaba
What kind a
Odd place is that

When you travel
On the whim

The city desolate
All the words
In that odd austrain language

I aint blind
I know whats up

Shit I always been
Scared of what
I regardless do

Put'n myself
Ever in position

To have to live
With hard choices

You might be cold
Shit'n no paper
In the same
Consistency as their coffee
+

My simple theory
' If I can see it
' I can get there

I told that man
Us alone near
Secluded military lands

His look of
Unsettled incredibility

Due to my
Assured certainty

Tho the storms
Centered on the mountains

Never permited me
To actually test
That theory
.

Trieste Italy

A german man asked
' How do you talk with people

When he learned
I didn't only knew Spanish

' I guess I don't
' Talk to many people

I casually negociated
With the train ticketeer
Him aside have'n
Offered to translate

The path laid out
To Innsbruck

Thru Northern Italy
In May blizzard

Pass'n a bum
Past 10

In a city
I understood only
As a small mountain town

Cold & Rain
Him huddled under
A shop ledge

Those you plead pity
Always fills me with disgust

Cold & Rain
My huddled wet
Under the trees

Hammocks are terrible
In mists
.
.
.
I only do
Lotta talk'n

Cause that why
I walk

Meaning for me
Is pride earned

Fk humility
I legit

Savor our moment
Cause you will
Always remember it

A unicorn
Mixed with a stray
Mangy mutt

Magesty only in the smile
Glad for each new day

Some people are
Too stupid
To see such things

These I have to
Explain myself
Which puts me
In awkward positions
Which I'm entirely
Accustomed too
.
.
.
The internet
Has isolated us

Islands
Alone

Early 00s
I met many people

Now all interactions
Without bonds
.
.
.
Every summit
I find
Lonliness unmasked

Were one thought
Pinnacles of debat

Forgotten grounds
Inmutable boulders

Trees all
Alpine runt

As if you betrayed yourself
Beguiled to a far away desolation

This the true motive
Under it all

Major players
In the unix community

Recognize me
As the loon half-baked
I embody

Deep & cold paths
Snow in proof
Of no other
.

Live today

'Like  its your last
'Or its your greatest

Live today
Only to remember

3rd attempt
To make ridge

Met with quick failure

You only ever
Need to suceed once

This time
Blunted Blazed & Ridgeside

They asked
Of my yoga

We performed
Sacrament

Beef Jerky
No water
Is never fun

Then the chug
Moutain Dew
In one hit

Sunrise pose
Inhale blunt
Rise exhale smoke

Blaine the choo choo train
Let smoke out
Only in small percentages
Inhale'n precentages of fresh
Hypervent out

Among blaze
We commited ritual

Solitary Ridgeside
Elune enshrouded
Late no light

All were blessed
With the cough

Lost deep
In foggyness
Of a lost state

Soul in
Perpetual Instability

Social smog of Failure
Too potent not to be fact

What strikes me hot
Above any understand'n

To others
Neutral Lukewarm
Spew from thy mouth
Away lunatic

But words
Keep flow'n

As long as my biches love me
I could give me a fk bout no hater

Im on that good kush
Imma ball to the day I fall

31 Aint so bad
Fair I see it shine
On everyone

Death I begin to fear
Greater with everyday

Life in that stillness
Caught of heart
As if all the universe
Needs a breather
For what bout to hit you

La Santa Muerte
Loves the surprised

She will catch you
& Your time slowed demise
Will be cherised

Fk Tomorrow
Natural path

If todays effects
Tomorrow so greatly

What greater proof
Do you need
To still do it

Sleep
I'm always an asshole anyway

My birthdays
Spent alone

Surprise Birthday
A wish itself

Alone on some
Forgien ground

But not that time
On that suicide
Ride down the mountain

I made it to Helena

A girl & friends
Greeted me a stranger
At a bar to celebrate my birthday
By word alone
But even such is powerful

Surprise
You aren't alone on your birthday

Tho it the expected outcome
Never been Montana way
.

'The quickest way
'Is not the straight path
'Of mathematics
'Karate

'Tai Chi
'To already be there
A mass of sticky hands

Believed it himself

Breathless moment
When a song
Is understood

Mayhap bypassed
Plenty before

Freddie Gibbs
'Just Tryin' Ta Make it

Birthed in me resolve
That succeed to Sneznik
A journey
That took many days

Against them locals
Aun to sneer
But I suceeded

Sneer me
I just smirk back

You
As the countless past

No where to find
To dance all up on
Mistaken faithless fks

Over the ear

Mayas well be speakers

Up on them streets
All in local cryptic

Bitches on the street
Gonna hear some

What I'd bring on you

Old women
Only need one look

To be told
To very depths

What I be bout

Only ever in tales
Never real to fk you

Then I come in
Roland of Gilead

It ends up being
My decision

Boxer Mickey
'Women make you weak

I dont allow you to ask
It is the regret of denial
That will haunt you everlasting
For have'n not taken
What had been demanded of life

Drama
Excrement of Society

My love is honest
Regardless of my love

That to me
Is my only definition

My sins
Swell unattended

Till

Launch in 
Avalanche

Never resist massive forces
Sith manuevers the momentum

Detriment to push past 
Until it overflow to power

There to summit
A new stage of life

Dick

The name my mother gave me
& She knows me best

As a Ranger
Of mountain realms

It is my obligation
To inform nonlocals

'This a flash flood area

'Stay close with your friends
'Moutain Lions live here

Helps ruin the day

.
I process data
Pretty goddamn good

This buys over
My odd personality

Task monumental to most
Solved offhand

From my true task of the day
In my day-to-day march to 1337

Aun physical tasks
All mainly machine type algorithmns
.
.
.
A Nation
Bent on 
Worldwide surveillence

Doomed
To enslave itself

Adriatic seaside
I understood

America
The only fate
I seek
.
.
.
America
Bought only a traitor

To whistleblow
On its surveillent state

Not the confession
Of community neighbors
Busy in its subversive tasks

What a day
What a day

When only a Snowden
Cured our ignorant state

A much better hacker am I
& I not a Russian Spy

If the call rise
May it be for my name
Next time
.

Life is something
That comes & goes

At the end
I hope as
Pheonix I fly

All flame 
In sudden glory

Then to darkness
Of the night

'Fuck the world
I'd first seen this sentence

On my wife's chinese shirt
Fate's message

My catch phrase now
'Fuck the world

'Fk the world
'How did I mess
'It all up again
Often sentiment
That goes with
My excited smirk
Mania & Lust

Out there
In the world alone

That is what
I am best at

Let youth
Give me the momentum

To fly

Didn't belong anywhere
Bury me best right here

Event at the apex
Life horizons death

Faith
Where I die sacred

It is death
That tells

A man's Tale
.
.
.
Like my Mission
Like my Appalachian Trail

Never once believed
I'd make the end

Now with all false faith
Stripped from me

Failure
The sound of Nothing

After my words
Are distributed abundantly

I just keep write'n
As I kept preach'n & hike'n

Cause the means
Is my favorite part
.
.
.
Ball'n
Is know'n 
How to ball with nothing

Once you get that ball
All well known

Just give me a little
& I flaunt all over it

But like a new car
It gets old

Tom cat life
Streets fk'd up

.
Skills
Matter most in life

Relationships end
Drugs can't create

Money flows
Best fresh like water

Things
All the things I need
I dont really like

Hammock, tent, pack, laptop
Sleeping bag, jacket
_

Been so cold
Thought I was die'n

& Those times
Are greatly overshadowed

What fate
Keeps me upon
Wings of luck

To this day
I knew I hit black

But my peanut skull
Uncracked

I remember my head hit'n
Asphalt at 70mi+

Motorcyle continue'n on
40 Yards

To smash into
A complete total
Against concrete wall

Due to
Wet damn leaves

I always met people online
It is more awkward than it may seem

But I am used to awkward
Home thru the cold rainy wasatch pass

When I got home
I couldn't take out my keys

Been at that always

Child read'n books
Child endure'n adventures

America
Police State

Life under powerful sects
Rule hardhandedly

Administrative Thugs
Unioned Federally

I believed
I would leave

But American is what I am
American to whatever end
.
.
.
Wrote a book
Published a bit

But most I can ever do
Is leave it on a trail

To the side
Underneath what looks to be
A few days drift
.
.
.
Merit means most
To most

I merit much
But now isn't the time

To sidetrack myself
On the petty run for payment

All I need
Is what I can make
A story out of

Now it is an
Archive Mainframe

It has been
Motorcycles 1, 2, 3, -> 4
Osprey pack
1lb Down sack
Work Tie
Scripture Set
Converse Shoes
Trek'n poles

Just give me whatever
I'll figure something out

Appalachian Epic of 3SHOT
MKRX Systems

A hacker weekend
Can change a
Monumental Project

Into a well & done
Right off the back

Plenty of
Coffee

Plenty of
Bud

Guided as if by
Poltergeist hands

Something passing through
As with one last chance
To make amends
That they channel
Through you

I have given
All I had to give
To everything in life

Of this
I am at true peace
.

Went back home
To Corpus Christi

At my old
Neighborhood grocer
Down the street

It looked like a
Crack Town

People stare'n
Why is he here

It is fascinating
How some things
Never change
.
.
.
It was years
After the incident

Camilla told me
'Yea you did
'You flew over the car

'Oh yea
After the distant memory
Of me fly'n over the car
Fifteen - Twenty feet away
Dazed & Confused
Find'n my way back

All I cared at that moment
Was that Camilla was okay

& That thank god
I decided prudence
Against go'n wild
Down the street
From that light

No Man is an Island

Doubtless John Donne
More alone than 
I could ever concieve

Surrounded by love
& acceptance by
All those around me

Bought by my childhood
Spent in seculsion

Solitude is all 
I ever seeked
Me vs them

It is hard
To accept

Unique
An kinldy adjective countless
Used to describe me

Not till my Mission
Did I understand utter lonliness

Blocked from communication
With only a jackass
Companion for company

Not in Mexico to baptize
On Crusades of Faith

To find who 
Call to fate for faith

Mayhap bypassed
In the ardour of work

Only ever walk'n
Belt too hot to touch

Whiteshirt & tie & kakis

I am just an 
Odd type of person

But I don't see
Much life in any other way
But completely devoted

I read much
Focused on much

Before the mission
I studied this book
Along with the 
Life of Christ

The 10 Commandments
Ten ways a society
Must live in order to survive

Past times after
Empires crumble lost

Tho themselves
Once their slaves

One commandment
Alone for worship

'Dont take
'The name of thy lord in vain

Which I became to understand
The religious backdoor
For control over society

As the Old Testament testifies
There is generally 
A good reason for it

You should not take
Another nations woman

Because soil
Determines the offspring

But which was unheeded
& Led to one of many downfalls

But the ancient way of life
To live as one simply devoted

It is worth meaning
To perserve past hardships

To awaken today
& Revolutionize your life

Worst is starve to death
One is assured to live at peace in

Literally shit out
Of all your luck

Who trusts the uknown
To pay up on credit owed

I got enough loans
To know that never
Works out as planned

So best have a good time
& Help others along the way

Hard choices
To redefine a life

I promised
Would have beautiful ends

John Appleseed
Knows he will never harvest

Know'n fate will take care
Of a few of the countless

To bring 
Appease love shade stability
For generations to come

All worth
If only for two

Tho to what end I can not know
The false hope of a sour granny
Or the sweetness of washington dry

Sow'n is all
I ever really want
To ever do

No worries of justifications
When that a physical impossiblity

Faith not abide'n
The laws of physics

Miracles no science 
Can be sure to define

So I left
A year & nothing

As if so busy
I never stopped to question

In the end 
Accept'n gratefully 
The void of nothingness
A vaccum that gorges all
To fill itself
With all manner of interesting

Faith I bore
Know'n the truth had left
But would one day
Come back around

Faith I have 
On my own found

In a life
Among bretheren

Whether
Physical or intellectual

Leave'n to posterity
Too great to be
Measured in generations

This book on a life
In a manner I hoped
Myself have'n had to recieve

I am 
adventurer hacker poet

& I don't care
Which one of you
Muthrfkrs know it

No man is an island
Did you follow me?

See your way thru
All the bull shit
& Hold the pearl
That is my wisdom

Or like all I met

In horror
Like disgust'n guts
Let it slap to the ground

Better covered gutterside
Under preferred sight of trash

& Thank god
You are all assholes like me
But much less deserve sight of it
Than to consume it greedily

Peaceful & pleasant
I walk faceless

Prince of Archives
Since '14

No longer
About file lust

A greater need presents itself
Independence of Humanity

Our anonymous right

But I look 
To the poor beasts
We eat or slave

A fate
I chose myself

But not one
I'm will'n to
In debt to posterity

Still I affirm
This fate I deserve

The mechanics of its motion
Longsince set

Trump Election
The thunderbolt sent by god
The universe or whatever

To crack open the earth
To be filled by our dead

Rattlesnakes
Expect & accept death

Death is the meat
Of its substance

Nobly
It finds death itself

& Sure as shit sticks
Better decapitate

Cause even four hours after death
It may get chance to strike death
Turn'n victor to victim
.

Preparation
Not only hoard'n

Hone the keeness
Of wiley skill

Live it up 
While it lasts

Long life
Isn't most important

Only to be
How I be

Till its
The end of me

Remembered in thousands
Over thousands of miles

I know how to have
A very good time

Those who partake
Of its angelic levity

Are drawn to a wild
World of rambunctious action

Warrant'n a return
Only in fond memories

Afterlife only
Offers reunion

To me memories
Best left as statues & monuments

The old man looked at me
On the fork to the interstate
Still at a distance
He conceeded

Vegas
Days to find
A suitable bush

Of which to mayhap
Find a few hours sleep

Perfect
It would house one
Comfy cosy & secure
Against a concrete ledge

Too perfect
About to settle down
Old man walks up
Still at a distance
& I walk away

One shot
Of me ever necessary

Pure
As alcohol burns

Hits 
Fierce as Salvia

The one time
We meet
Like a needed 
But extremely uncomfortable experience

To any garden
Whose heart harbors my memory

You would swear

In latter days

If lost on valley floor
Smooth planes of ease
Stir alien horror

Path found

On a log
Over a ravine
Miles into the Jungle

Trapped
Like a bug in a web

Hang'n full suspension
Every joint
Held by a thorny vine

Confident as a master
In my compass skills

Naught till I was 
Well into the jungle

Discovered

Swept to the wind

With great respect

Inevitably
He took me
As an asshole

Like a slub on saint pattys

Soaked regardless of tarp

Much more admirable

'Fresh Carribean Rolls
'President Trump

'Of any person
'Ever in existence
'I'd take Trump

'Free to get wreq'd
'As we want

Those words the gateway
To its reality

As if the universe
Played passive
To hearts desire

Putin roll'n
Coked up with thugs

He didn't greet me
It wouldn't be proper

But he gave me a 
Swift look

That was as 
Solid & Invite'n
As handshake

Of the 2 tables
All out
But the 3 of us

50 Million dollars
& Both my kidneys
On the table

Hooked up & handled
By a Nobel Laureete

'All In
I called

Eyes on Putin
'Maybe I make you Russian
He laughed pleasantly
'Call

Trump who was only in
Because he put me to lose
For a few
Lost of interest easily responed
'Call

King of Clubs 
3 of Spades

Made me a millionare

They were ever out

Just jet'd in

The Laurette busy work'n 
But us three casually talk'n

Trump & Putin
Neverend'n 
About their adventures

Save'n the world
From ninjas to androids
To when they had to breach dimensions

Third-wheel those hours
My highlight

Before the end
I'd instigate 
The action
Of the end of the world

Into a night
That even they 
Would never forget

No pics or vids
Never forget'n
Trump crowned 
With a gold MAGA cap

On the grounds
OF the National Monument

At peak flight
Of Putin's 
Russia Special Dip

Myself have'n used a tie
To makshift a thong

Nudity for a reason
No one could remember

Run'n from hummers
Escaped into the 
White House

For a reason
None of us remembered

Have'n to get
Soaked in the thorny bush
Cold & naked
But do'n my best not to show it
In presence of King Putin

Thru a window 
President Trump left open
For this exact purpose

We hoisted ourselves
Leave'n blood streaks
That already got 
Distant dogs howl'n

Pass'n out
On the Presidetial Rug

Have'n to lay on
Last weeks hooker's towel

Wake'n up mid-air
Freak'n out
Tethered to a helicopter

Get'n pulled up
By Russian Special Forces

Grab'd inside by
Princess Ivanka 

On critical mission
To protect the life
Of our Princess

From the BLM squad
Sent by Barak Obamamma

Bullets flew
Spotlights ever accurate

I caught the blaze
As if on premonition

It at the corner of my eye
A laser weapon from space

As if pulled
I took Princess Invanka 
In my arms

Unhindered by the
Hopeless Russians

We lept
In a hurdle'n mass
Princess in arms

The flash of a beam
Gone but linger'n as a ghost

Erupted the helicopter
In blue explosions

Duck pond
Against air pressure
But the only option

There allowed the
The Princess unharmed
From land'n thru me

Saved by her
All muddy & fierce
As she unstuck
Me deeply embedded
In the muddy muck

Bruised
But nothing broken

Princess Ivanka
Carried me to 
A 10 hut village
Which became apparent
Was North Korea

In the local dialect
She asked for
Gum cigarette coca-cola
Cooper-wire & rubber gloves

She ladder'd to the powerlines
Took apart her ear'n
& Hack'd herself 
Into the direct line
Of His Majesty Kim Jong

A limo
Rated nuclear-bunker

Soon picked up the Princess

Inside the mod Cardinal
An immensity of a man
Put put his hand 
As I made way to enter

The man's hand
The size of my chest

I was too muddy
& The interior was sacred

'Go to Bangladesh
'To the Royal Sweet

A business card
Hidden by his massive fingers
Fluttered lightly down 
As he drop'd it 
For me to catch

The Princess cried
At the brisk part'n

A last micro second sight
Of beauty in memory

Precious past probabilty
Liable for fruad

After the sounds
Of the large engine
Lost in mountain passes

Dazed at the last 
24hrs Exactly
When I bumped into 
President Trump

North Korean Mountains
Starve'n in only a tie-thong

Excellent in health
Relative to my history

In Mexico
The women of the church
Would feed us our 2pm meal

An excommunicated witch
Was allowed to feed us

Grateful I never
Questioned her lifestyle

She would serve us
Extremely dark gravy 
Heavily spiced meals
Of mystery meat
My companions took
As chicken hungrily

Her golden serpent ring
Openly revealed herself

As she would lay down
That Sunday meal
_

Witchcraft
Lost to the North

Since child in tune with the streets
In their homes visit'n as church-people

None was even heard of
What is a staple of Mexico

Sects of this
Solitary religion

Dark Masters
In veiled niches

A plain putrid malice
They set up as shrine 
To their odd ways

Self-sacrificed to 
The Lord of Vengence
[[
Whom many erroneously
Voice as La Santa Muerte

A god who wishes
People die as they live

At least that is
My feel'n
]]
Craftsmen in Concoctions
Vile past beastly

Kept in jar
Buried or hidden

Or only some
Spetictude

At the home
Of the victim

Parts of bodies
Of vengeful dead

Sent enroute
To regain the flesh stolen

Enraged at the desecration
Are the belief of this craft

Or a small vial
Enough to stink
An entire nieghborhood block

Parts of almost every marketplace
Contained dealings for such

Hacker
In an anti-hacker state

Crocker the first hacker I knew
Lived alone at the 'park
Found 1337 thru insomnia
Book by book he read

The FBI expelled
Him from all universities

After Novell told the government
Who was told by the schools admin

Who was told by Croker himself
Report'n a hole that opened
Free access to the network

A typical story
In hacker circles

Omniscient power
Is power over ignorants

My country whines
Why are Russian hackers better?

As it maliciously treats
Wizards as witches

Inject'n my traffic
With packets

As they conspire 
To manufacture 
Probable warrants

So what is a 
Muthrfkr to do

That is too Texan
To leave america

Just try to be good enough
To get outta any situation

Russians may have 
Well fed hackers

But true is beauty 
Where naught else blooms

But in the end decided

I'd go to local university
& Use their gym

I saw legs
At a vend'n machine
In the distance

But I remembered in a panic
My milkshake needed ice
From the cafeteria on the other side

These weight gainers
Were slightly work'n

Think'n how I'd
Finally amassed

I see the legs
In the distance
Leave'n the vend'n machine

I caught up to her
Invited her too meet me

Narcissist
Since before
Narcissism was the state
Of earth's society

I revile them
Hack'n cheaply
In their imitations

Empty masks

Narcissim is deep
Conviction towards personal developement
Oneself as sacred shrine
Ones life as prophetic miracle

Sell out?

Like a priced whore

Of tactless & tasteless

Bask'n under shadow of Fortune
A mistress of treachery

Definitions of weak-minded fools
Who pretend to reconcile
Upon fantastical ledgers

Naught in life

Nothing is identical
Nothing can be aggregated
In such simple fashions

Myself a function
Ere a storm

Most laid waste
By the wake
Of my pass'n

Only the weak
Will fall

For better ways
For better seeds

In evolution
Of mother nature

So what am I?

I have brought oceans of darkness
To those I love

I have brought blessings neverend'n
To those I hate

Since I lost
My rudder live built me for

I been directionless
Since then fearless & alone

Guilty
As the come

Before Judge
& Other locals

'What do you plead?
She asked me

In a complex 
Internal debate

I forgot the options
& I arrived late

After instructions
& Kept there debate'n

Then finally said
'Guilty
Cause fk it I was

It was a spectacle
That everyone thought mad

'I kept on the back roads
'But I mean 
'Who wouldn't do
'What I did

Everyone like
Who the fk
Is this guy?
Is he on something?

If you think 
Me without my Jane
Is odd

Find you back ways
I will show you

The what you experience
Will be like a unicorn
Something alive tho now lost

Promise'n some insanity
Is gonna happen soon

Shit
If that aint prophecy

Then what is

What can I say
You aint real 'Murican
If you don't think you some prophet

Badass Preachers
Is that self-righteous white way

But you always 
Uncertain if its not true

To me in my life

Bitches money alcohol
Things

Fk that hell
I nothing
But I still got
A whole lotta
Everythang

This that
Only ever temporary

Seasons change
Along with seanery

Face this
Or face that

Never gonna
See them again

I only know
How to pass on
In pay forward
To other momentums
That mayhap
Circle to he
How prior blessed me

With some fresh food
Aun fresh water

Directions
Knowledge if this way or that

There are countless
As a missionary I can talk
To a whole lotta people

Easy for me to get
Karma to loop

If life is just
Destruction of possibilities

As we follow to reaction
As variables of lifes equation

Consequence
To consequence

Quantum reactions
Fireworks on a Texan Bay

Each descision 
Like thunder
It vibrates 
To exisitences
Of many spheres

Myself never less
Of a pyromaniac

Glory at it

Easy when wander'n

In circles
Or around

Complete in complements

Worked over & over

Comes as ready ways

No my fault
You come to my paths

Brainwashed
In certain ways of think'm

A toil harded seed
That will bloom
In an infection of sanity

A cloud of it
Fog to all

I want to be remembered 
For it all

That is the dark door
Well shined for all

As are portals 
To a new dimensions

Quantum to quantum
Tunnel opened & soul cast thru

To awake to new worlds
& Past realities

Voyered Dreams
Birth a scheme

Then as one
Thru the hack of salvia
Crouch'n jump'd thru

But he the dumbass
After the black of flame
Bloom the new evolved generation

To be grandfather
To entire eras

As the spring to river
Ones position inherited by eternity

A wanderer
Vagabond traveler

Suits my kind

Always get'n into
Some dire shit

Ready to let
More experience take charge

For better 
Or worse
But mostly worse

Their choice not mine
To let me drive

But I'll happily
Venture a bold way

An honor 
Not taken lightly

Many morn
In sadness of tragedy

Mayhap that experience
Evolve to meet prior gap

Sacrifice of honor
All graciously submit

Like the tired
Rattlesnake mother

After have'n seen
The escape
Of her young

Made her weak
& Made her meat

Ponder'n this alone
Too hot or too cold
Upstream Selway

A Theme

Just before breach'n
To true wilderness

A mother bust 
Into the open

I took off my rifle
& Aimed

Test'n only the movement
Never mean'n to fire

She simply stared at me
In what became
Obvious self sacrifice
As the young bust down
Cross & continue
She only afterward followed

Life is to my kind
Is one that should
Have those sorrows

To experience
Is what I'm about

In this new reality
23 Hit salvia
Greet'n a brother
I'd never met

Full of odd people
Hardly enough to adventure on

My wife is a blessing
My write finally intelligble
With goods to get by

Pleasant season far from
Winter long forgotten

I follow messages
In Fortune Cookies

No man is my master
& I got what it takes
To carry my own weight

Fk the police
My arch enemy

The sight of them
Fills me with vile hatred

My deepest wish 
To have power

To crush them slowly
Beneath my boots laughing

The source of this hatred
Found in no singular experience
It is a natural state of relationship

They hate me
I hate them

We recognize each other
For who the other is

Proofs are seen
In invisible traits
_

I been cuffed
Too many times
For me to recall
Even a fraction
& That is only
In high school

Still at 30 
Get'n cuffed 
On a regular basis

Fkn system
Sk my dick
I'll fill them
With something to cry about

But underneath that hatred
Is always a intrinsic love
As they wouldnt be them
Without people like me
& Vice versa

Senior year in advanced math
Cops came in demand'n me

Fortunately, 
This was one of the few days
That I attended class

They cuffed me in front of everyone
Then walked me out the entire school

All the teachers who respected me
Throughout my high school career
Finally confirmed what I be about

Not many even at Miller High
Get that kind of treatment

An honor I took
With head held high
& Smirk in my eye

Cause if you ever met me
That is Classic Richie
_

Or that one time
Re-enact'n Dazed & Confused

For the first time
Get'n caught by the PoPo

Lesson learned never hide
These police know these streets

Dumb muthrfkrs get juked 
Eazy enough on foot

Turns out I knew the cop
'I'm disappointed in you Richie

He wanted me to talk my way out
& Mayhap not get set to county
With the other sorry 3 that got caught 
Out of the many

My silver tongue
I hold sacred

It only to be used
To manuerver this or that

To tarnish it 
By beg'n out reprieve of punishment

I ain't scared of shit
Cause life is a story

& Thats the story
Of how I got criminal record
& Sent to County
Since I was a month into 17
*
*
*
I believe in myself
That I can make a difference
To save humanity from itself
& Retain its independent heritage

To oft
I see the ants
All labor & toil

Never excited
Only for the 
Greater good

Fkkkkkkk
That

I respect the independent
As one himself

They system naturally
Wants power to surpress

But what right
Do the governments of the world
Have to destroy borderless roams?

Man must have the option
Behave or GTFO

Humane expulsion to some unwanted grounds
Or submission for retribution

Oh that I lived
100 Years from now

To be labeled 
Disturber of the peace
& Sent to Mars
To make my way
With others convicted
Of the same crime
To establish 
A new frontier
With people 
I much prefer

Its all backup
I expect the law of demons
To follow the law of men
In that if 
Under the Influence
A pact is voided

If that doesn't hold true
A rite may have transacted
The triumph of liberty
For my soul

After two years on the mission
What could be worse

Whatever fate my dumbass digs up
I have faith the consequences
Of my carefully crafted actions
With ring true for generations

I can't sell out
Or by now I would have bought in

I care little for most people
I care little for most things

Most times only care about
The legend I swear in ink

10 Years as a writer
Almost half that as hacker

Never made a cent 
Of either pursuit

Fk the world
I have enough

A land to legend over
Some weed to keep me on beat

If I'm lucky
With someone like my wife

If I'm not in state
Of any state I desired

I spend most of my wake'n hours
Craft'n a plan B

Which due to such 
Nervous revisions in anxiety

Seem to be 
More of my suite

Make you Plan B
Better than your Plan A
& Life has twice the chance
Of work'n out as plan'd

hacker adventuer poet
All I got to do is just one of those

adventurer by season
hacker as mission
poet natural by typical richie rants

& If it fall
Ever only gibberish

Fk it

I only do what I do
Cause thats what I do

False judge to pitiful beggar
Keep away from me please

Much more pleasant
Is the presence of a hungry critter
Take'n up old pack food as treasure

Or bird in response
To calls made yourself

Blindness aun silence
Of mountain nights
Where one learns by feel

Path by foot's sole
Weather by feel's skin

Monkeys I finally understand
In their protective cages
Ever in petty squabble
Aun to death 
Throw'n feces at each other
Responsible of not of own actions

When a depended alone
He was a much nicer person

Early morn by bus
To get across town

On her other Sister

'Oh fk'n god
'Oh fk'n god

As the bus pulled up

'What WHAT?
The other shake'n out of her

Vegas 3rd day without sleep
Scooped up past midnight
With this guy from Defcon
So lost from reality
A girl spoke to him
At a bar & had to tell him
Explicitly she was a hooker

He said I could crash
On his hotel floor

At the room
His friend treated
Him like loose-brains

Misty the dickhead
Recounted how a stripper
Pleaded for a rescue

$1,500 & didn't get none
On that crumb chase

Head in-hands
Come'n to grips

What they do

I needed
No role model
Neither do you

Trust in yourself
Prayers are answered

To never surrender
Up a dream

Will pave your way
To consequence

Journey in mean'n
Gaze to Elune

Trust in yourself
& Forgive others

Life in Legend
Today next step

No man
Can serve 
Two Masters

Worship experience
Understand sorrow

Entropy effects all
Money Love & Skill

Why then
Do we live

This short time
On waves of
The Big Bang

Am I only 
Firework

To play out
In sporatic beauty

Defined in
Mathematical algorithms

Spark aun shine
For time ever
To look-back & see

Codes standardize actions

Machines live by code
Predicatability gives power
Impossible for humans

Power thru parallelism

Not a debate
Of success or failure
Only of heart

Heart is to do
Devoid of all-else

On stable ground
Not sandy shore

Of a life

Lived in the era

When you realize

You are the 
True devil

Devils or Earth

Each has different meters

Ms. Hawkins
My 3 year english teacher

She would tell use
Of her hated past

KKK threat'n to 
Gather & shoot
Our entire school up

Force'n Sharpton to cancel
Run'n for Presidency

Hate in a well-worn spot
Filled since the begin'n

Tho in relative peace
The pit too wide
& Too deep

America
I'm proud
We did our best

Regardless of failure

The soil too tainted
With the pollution of evil

The Civil War
Broke the Constitution
Of freedom to states
A Federation formed

Day-to-day disappointments
As neighbors turn
On their duty

The judge sworn
The leader elected
The general entrusted

All failed us
Start'n with the first

Humane logic cast off
For bias algorithms

Our country not been 
The Land of the Free
Since that war

Every war after
In breach likewise

Does history
Have answer to good decisions

Adventure 
Is my reason for being

Life as it comes
On far off scapes

Here & There
For that moment

Tho every where
Not much different
From anywhere

It is a small
World after all

Despite global times
It is the inheritence
Of curious types
To venture freely

Iquazu Argentina
Thru Jungle trail
With a local teen
We met bushwack'n

We went to all his spots
Spent the afternoon together

He wanted to become a pilot

Many friends in that program
I doubted him

But life is what it is
& If its not

It is to you that right
To prove the world wrong

Is or not
State of reality

I keep on my own
Never respect those who do'nt

Actions play out
Success only pollution

Fate a vortex tunnel
Pull'n me towards

Empowered by force of prayers
*

I felt bad
For worn torn victims

Now I understand
The lessons of sacrifice

A great cost
Certain rights lost

Spirit of Independence
Vanished since
Civil Wars lost

Never about slavery

Only about right
To remain independent

Forced down submissively
In matters that make
Men cannon-fodder

To our fall
From Democratic
To Communism

Lone wolf dies hard
Homogenus are marshmellos

Why does the cow live
Calm an unperturbed

From the reality
Of life around them

Life ruthless as Aquatic
Life ruthless as Jurrasic
Life ruthless as Infestation

Lush to barren
As the elderly
Eastern earths

The hives will
All feed upon
Each other eventually
When wrap'd round
The entire planet

Peak of

Computers were made
To do amaze'n things

Only one weak man
Against a omnipresent foe

If you didn't know

Total fk'd
That realization when
You vs pavement
As bug on windshield

But a man 
Has got to have
A good time thru it all

Has always been there
For me in the past

Bitch so much

Nothing less than
He who bites the 
Hand that feeds

Irratic & intense
Ever too into

The panorama of scope
Expansions of horizons

Encryption is bullshit
Math is the definition
Of a backdoor

Fk the police

One must understand 
The thugs of the enemy

Used by their masters
As dogs put in harms way
To extort people to order

Cry'n or laugh
Always in bullshit

With a cops head
Weasle'n this way or that

Daily life in danger
More than another profession

Used by municipalities
As tax collectors

7:30am Till 8:30am
I waited for him

Cop first thing of day
Come'n over cheerily

The police had found 
My motorcycle
Parked behind a building

Cop as enthusiastic as myself
We tried to re-engineer 

How the joyrider
Cut my wires

The officer was the sharp one
He helped me reconnect my wires

I never did
Thank him enough for that

Life is hard on them
I Pray they learn from it

I wouldn't be me
If there wasn't a them

I like being able
To cuss out a 
Muthrfkn cop
When one passes
From a safe distance

It lightens my day
To let out some hate

I aint ever seen 
A cop flip their shit
Without instigation

Social movements 
All focused against the police

Who follow codes
Made by legislative-powers

Dumbass generation
[[ The only person
Stoopider than a ignant

Is a privledged hipster
Educated only in

Go take your vendettas
To the right zone

Lay off 
Our grounds

Constantly on the run
From warrant to warrant

Cops aren't play'n fair

Remembered exemplified

Reveals its mind

Wonder

Defiance

Playfulness

How is it

As mere material?

Steak from animal
Wild who fkd-up

Not enslaved to eat
& Be eaten

Humanity as witch of
Hansel & Gretel

War torn future
May learn us

To respect all
What were offhandedly-lost

Freedom life & liberty
In distinctly different views

As States to themselves
Not sheeps of socialism

Confederates
Robert E. Lee

Lost what we
May yet win

I see as our future
Of what we rightfuly deserve

Cooked in our own ovens
Dividends of lifes-work
Given to the kids
We once herded as cattle

America Asia Europe 
Lost its liberty

Will South America
Take up the torch

Myself rejected
Silence shamed

But to me
I sense the calm of autumn

Fall a change of color

Rejection past familiar
The taste of it favorable
From it I feed

Zen & The Art 
Of Motorcycle Matinence

Not aimed to
Entertain nor informed

Continue thru thought

Have I been
Contacted by dead

Indisputable

But to life
Is for live'n

To the dead
Long & Gone

I say 
Farewell

Spirit like water
Must flow forward

Any earthly anchor
Festers poison

Life is a flame
It expands brightly

Which way no man
Will ever know

To shape it
Would be treason

Like extract'n paint
From a masterpiece

Too  intelligent
To conform

Sometimes intelligent
Enough to lead the masses
To understand why

I am good
Excellent in odd-ways

Tp see my destination
From my path is ludicrous

I way this or that
In a fluid thru

If fate 
Permits us time

You will never
Forget the lessons
I will teach

To grabs on ideas
Like strings of puppets

Play out logic
To your tune

A recipe cursed
With a heart of insanity

Once that door
Opened evermore

Cold gust
Chills for life

Fresh air
Tantalize'n more taste

Imbalance wonky
Enough to breath
Causality to paths

Man more than machine
In the rut it carves
For the future

Divergent

Many years dedicated
To the service

Right around in that time

Pray we all
Ignorant of our rewards

Touched by me

Ardent labor
On forgien earth

Mocked over & over

Labor Sacrifice Devotion
To all others

Now years later
I understand
Lessons learned

& Thank god
I banked it

Cause the Appalachian Trail
Was some by-miracle-only-shit

That is some far off time
To have some shit paid off

I bet god
Didn't think
I'd live to cash-in

But here I am
Independent & In-debt

Able to live
As I please

Achievements matter little
Unless the achiever known

Of how their life went

Grounds a common theme

Of critical decisions

Worth the effort till death

Bushwack'n thru Slovenia
Rollercoaster of a day

Got weed 
From locals at a pub

Passed thru
Weed cartel houses

Dirt paths led 
Different ways

Path sides protected
With military ambush pockets

Hummers at times
Go'n this or that

Sure
This was a 
Russian Invasion

I nearly shitmyself
When Hummer full of soliders
Roll'd up behind me

I cut deeper 
Into the woods

I heard something
Track'n me in the woods
Myself on dirt road

After time
I went to investigate
Near to the thicket

Responded a 
Crinkle of advancement 

The threat of it
Openly to me

I cut thru 
The fk out of there

The action of it
Resembled a man
Use'n knife to hunt

Fly'n a mile 
In a fluster

A giant siberan dog
Comes up on me
Before I can react

Collared & Friendly
Only the only civilian car
I'd seen since I entered the woods

I met a man 
At the mouth
Of the woods

Who informed me
This was government land

& Great fears calmed
He also laughed
About the dog
As if the dog his
Which he never told


Cut'n thru a
False church
Nested against the woods

It merely the
Veneer of a steepled church
In reality a garage

Great open hilltops
In military arrays

Barren but ready
This all woods

Dispite the miles deep
Dogs howl'n behind

Which but me on edge
To the howls 
At the hilltops

Myself below
Past dense thicket

Trek'n poles
Allow'n me over
Normal limits

To plantation-esk lands
All without electricity
Over odd boulders
Splattered by massive amounts of bats
Over a creek bridge
Past a borded up house
That was well-maintained

GoPro wack'n the fk-out
& Never after work'n

To miles cross'n a highway
To a town
Then to the rails

Double tracked
Back to the town

A howl was heard 
At the crux of the road

The howl was then
Heard in direction 
Of the tracks

I spent the
Cold rainy night

In a homely bustop
Against the church

Right around the corner

Thud from a long-fall'n mass
That hit in the alley ahead

Ear's tell'n me
It fell from the sky

Trek'n poles affront
My back to wall
Face to entry
Ready to get fk'd
By Slovenia Vampires
That tracked me 
With werewolves

'eeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhh
Came a cry of agony past human

Heart stop'd
The future too intense
To care any further

The wall the side
Of a church monestary

Fortune placed me
Securely

I was able to nap
Off & on in rare spells

4:30am Awake
Local wake'n
To his farm duties

A barrage of accustaive meows
Began to emerge unappeased

Have'n been left out 
All rainy night

After have'n believed
So assuredly of something

It exists
Evermore

Russians Werewolves Vampires
Can life still surprise me?

With 3Chop
Top of bushwacked hill

We met a man
He drew me a map
That was perfectly accurate
Up until the part
Of get'n back to the trail

Possible suspicion
Grew further 
By the recent horse tracks

Our position 
In a real-fkd position
If shit went
As bad as it could

So to be sure
We bushwacked up
This mountainside hill

Wait'n almost an hour

Prolonged intense

Till heard asid
A light scuffle
Followed by
The snap of a twig

Heart stop'd
Eyes wide

I farted

Break'n that tense silence

My sister look'n back defensively
~That one is totally on you

That was the time
She understood I went crazy

But to me
A small sidetrack
Worth the various redflags

Damn

I know

We have access too
Are heavily adjusted

Hungry & not have'n

To stay on course
Venture'n till end

Victory in echoes
Of futures to follow
Learn mean'n to being

If a pussy-ass muthrfkr
Caught as prey surrounded
Cry out in plea for help
Learn then what one really is

When shit hit fan
On my masterplan

Furthest thought
Be beg'n like a bich

Get'n on top
Takes all one has

Failure is a 
Muthrfkr

When I return
Back to civilization

Like a stray
You know had
Longterm struggles

Almost as often
As I fail

Are faces in shock
At the sight of me

All fked up 
Maybe bleed'n

Pop'd out of
Portrayals heretofore
Only of immagination

Remote darkness
Pop'n out impossible

Materialized from
Unhabitable remote zones

Such blessed sight
Draws a enlonged lip
To meet my eye

Brash boasts notorized
To what I did succeed in

Failure 
Falls to tolerable allowance

2nd Saturday
Of Fall 2017

Broke further
Til unfamiliar paths

Hours soaked legs
Where gale frost

With winters vengance
Warning of what
Is yet-to-be

Further I climbed
When I thought
I'd be descend'n

Snow over'n 
My past tracks

I retreated
Know'n to stop
Meant possible death
This high ridgeside

Hands about to give
Wounds from numbness

Beat'n to learn
Never underestimate a mountain
Even the most familiar
So high up
Law yields to
Boundless etherium

The boast of my heart
Fills my sails to go
But I must know
The limits of my craft
.
.
.
I been stranded
Near a 13000ft
Idaho summit

Hitch'n on road
All caught
In cold front

Alone stranded
Know'n with no
Sucess within hours
The effort would turn life threatening

The rancher picked me up
Offhandedly
Tow'n horse in back
Brag'n about his 
Cowboy rodeo son

I don't he ever understood
What a hero he was to me
.
.
.
Day-to-day experiences
Are were true treasure lie

Open sentinel eyes
Vigilant to pounce

To those are laid
Beauty of boundless things

Inside journeys
Begin with preparation

Finally since moved in
Almost 2 Year ago

I the throne room 
In total order

Ever since the
Hacker spirit left

Open books highlighted
Manual pages & reference texts
Computer parts large & small
Candlewax overspewed everywhere
All in mid-swing project

The place plastered
As HAQR

Hopefully as weeks go by
This throne will be plastered
Among the same in reknewal
.
.
.
The sin of arrogance
Pays in full as all

Half-Cocked
Think'n it full
Get caught as bich

When fate turns
A real muthrfkr
_

Humility to know
One has gone far
But the journey
By hidden turns
Rises ever higher

One must have prudence
To be able to retreat
To evolve and move on
Up again as before
Or to a side anew
.
.
.
I appear
As mangy stray

Clutch'n something
Too obnoxiously precious
To be real

To others this
Tacky display

What prince of men
Aun Prince of Archives
Would go about in
Such weatherworn rags
.
.
.
My inspiration
Hits with
Potence of forefathers

Submissive my tongue
Presents the gate
To your path

Tho as strangers
We meet

In your eyes
Revealed the struggle
The decision to
Ever enter it

Gates closed
Gates opened

Doors
A beautiful thing

Whether taken
Or left unanswered

In that Native
Offhand way

To parse data

What gets simpler

Used against the machine

The Prince of Archives

To exponet 
Each additional File

Not only society
But math

Calls me out
In error

But in this 
Divergent Trajectory

So brite to my eyes
Upon which I can
See the glow of fate

Fk the government
Fk the academics

I believe my heart
Much sooner than you

Troll'd since
2014 DefCon

I have a spider
I kill its brother

Each on one web
On bathroom sink

One I took out
By rubberband shot

Still aroused 
By fly hunts

The other spider
Knew it was fk'd

An earwig
Crawled near 
My toothbrush

So I gave
My enemy a job

Flick'n bug to
An exact hit

The sider 
In primal lurch

Bit it instantly
_

Drain'n glass at 
Kitchen sink

A spider
Have'n long been defeated
By that trap

Know'n a flush
Would be hell

Look'n at me
& I considered it

But took chopstick
& Laid it in front

The spider
Step'd to trust
But then recoiled

After the next failure
I let down again

It thankfully
Took took step

On the bank
Of the sink

The spider long
Looked consider'n
As if thanks
_

Aside my mat
My clean clothes
Lay as dens

Upon lift'n on
A giant beautiful spider
Past full grown

Fur in that dirty-grey
& Greys deep black

Orbs the shine
As if osbidian

[[ That obsidian of my youth
[[ In Idaho always about

Mayhap that the same
But who can tell

I'd say I can
Buts thats 
Just me being me
.
.
.
There lies
A jitter'n mania
In my eye
Close to the glint

It is only 
By that personal contact

One can understand
The situation
Of me in life

A primal wilderness
Is caught in me

Feral as cat
Prudent as cat

My calm countenance
Is in perch
To pounce in need

Humanity's soul
Not so far from animal

Stranger by cliff
Or passanger on road

Immediately sense this
As if a whiff of stench

It hits them as something
So real but long forgotten

I see this struggle
In our brief contact

Good for them
As animals I tell

We are enemies
Never let guard down

The lesson is
Interactionless on my part
But I feel
It is a necessary service
.
.
.
Outcasts
Far enough
From society
To give fks

Weed smoke
That potent

A cloud
That lingers

We freely partake
If other bold enough
A real bond there

Know'n an sec
This chill 
Could turn bust
To a run

In the hoods
It gave us unity

Black Mexican White
Only hate'n on cops

With Leagalisation 
All that has changed

Luckily
Most places but here
.
.
.
Enough food
In my pack

I could get that
Out of the universe

All strays know
wassup
Shined from eye

Those hard times
Hope never again

To the point
Attachments safely bind

Hacker to the 
Point of prophet

Modern Mormon

Histories of 
All these generations

Stored on
Aluminum Plates

Data which
Will one day be lost

Undisputed archive
Cept from archive.org

But if they want
To compare shas

I bet my life
My archive better

Been across the world
In brags unthwarted

unix zfs perl
1337 haqr life

The lifework
Of one legendary muthrfkr

Larger than life

This the crown
On arrays of knowledge

Of righteousness
Of wickednesss
Of academia
Of entertainment

Got it all
Alone like Mormon

At the last days
Before the 
Trump Days

What better set up
Could life present

Putin Trump 

& All in-between
Thats also me

Handmade Ark
Cost'n everything

Unsteady in solitude
When so much
Depends on me
Not fk'n it up

That is my
Favorite part of life

Balls to the wall
When cutoff survive'n

Can't imagine
Roll'n my ark
To where I need to go

Not like I 
Planned this

The path
Wilted the way

Presumptous
As boulder

Proclaim'n itself 
Temple

Know the past
& Current position

To see ahead
A great pyre

Of existence
To infinities

Shaped by alien hands
Into a throne of worship

Pablo I hope
You are alright

Work'n the hotels
You & your girl

Meet'n me at Yunke summit
That rainy morn

We conversed

10 Min still left
Of jungle road to go

I had you timed
& On que you pulled over

I don't know how I knew
But there was something about you
.
.
.
If the end
Goes as I see
My archive tesitfy
In undirected surety

The depravity of capitilism
Slaves of the wage

Cash can't keep
Man true to word

Cash can't bring
Honor to wife

Cash can't bring
Precious by price

Fktheworld
I have enough

Mean'n in craft
A sweet dry fruit

A wine that
Ages in glory

Let us 
Learn this lesson
Only once

Each day
For difference

A turn
Followed by steps

Life gets hard
Starved Dehydrated & Freeze'n

As long as
It be the means
By which I talk some shit
Worth all it

Here There
Anywhere

Whereever
Always pen & pad

Hope'n for dividends
Like Johny Appleseed

That posterity blessed
With the insanity
That is my fruit

Mayhap too much
For its hit alone

Mix it with smoke
Of the kush bush

Enjoy outside
Where rules run dry

In that company of circumstances
The product take you next level
.

Local punks
I always front
A bit hard
To leave them
Haunted in their schemes

Till aun ghost of it
Spook them to another path

Than fantasies of 
Get'n me out

Unproven
I am anxious
.
.

If I die
Before next wake

I pray a soul
My word to take

Breathed by life
A new generations

Apt to adventure
Curious in hacks

Poetry
Is all a gag

This aint poetry
No hidden mean'n
No superposition of enlightenment

This is history
It is as it is

hacker adventure poet
Transendent
From ape heritage

This work
Only cryptic
To those of no effort

This work
Passes insubstantial
To those dulled
To the passion of experiments

Others 
I've deeply admired

Looked their Judges
In their fat-faces

To condemn
Corrupt muthrfkrs
To Hell

Damned is the man
Betray'n oaths sworn
In daily-off-handed violations

May my blood pool
As countless pass
In cohalition 
That no dam
Can long hold

That ghostly energy
To wash away
All grown by way
Of corruption

The curse of
Capilitism

Humainty sanctified
To whore out

Sold out
To any payer

Better butter bread 
& Water rations
Dignified to simple pursuits
.

A place
Without drugs

fkn lame
1984 lame

Unbind
Dog from leash

To roam free
At own speed

There I find friends
Best suited for me

I go hard
Regardless of day

Night or morn
Cold hot rainy
Sheltered in

Got a mission
For every circumstance

When we converse
I can see
You go languid

How the fk
Can I respect

A vile keep'n me me
Natural disdain

Fat slime'n by
Ooze all in all

Think you all
So cute for selfie

Then wonder why
Myself a hawk
Decline to eat you

All others
Are this to me

Vibrancy of form

Not know'n what
But ready still

Can't get to Antartica
Immediately to win lotto

That possiblity is
NULL

But a person who
Chose instead to 
Previously move to Antartica

That possibility is
Inevitable

Combined with the
Laws of Probability

Take'n the
Most difficult route

But a route
To certain ends

Are in dire need
Because few will choose

But the wayfarer
Tho hardened
By hard life

Reaps sweet fruits
Everymore

That is the
Belief of 
Quantuawicca

Every action
An explosion

On the waves
Of the
Big Bang

Naught is chaos
Only design

Evolution in
Fight for life

Or man made
Fireworked in designs

To create a masterpeice
Out of days
Of ones life

Recognize strong bonds
Keep them

Nurture them
In herbal ways

Keep gateways
Oiled & eazy

Acceptance to fate

Hope'n on possibility
To roll well

Not of ingratitude
For what in the past
Filled your coffers

Only in love
Of a fate

Instinct
Not bullshit dna memory

The quantuam mechanics
Of bold passagers
Back seat drive'n

Themself safe
Think'n this only dream
But mayhap only the one voice
To present a solution
With that weight 
Of think'n this 
Truly is you

Without believe'n
Your life at stake
This rule becomes exploited
By dark forces
That originate from 
An evil you

Devotion
Strict codes

Hull of boat
On wavy waters

Whatever wrong
These borders never breached
Only by poor craftsmanship

Several weeks forgotten
Program'd logic
True till end

That is happiness
To a mastercraftsman

On the trail
I moved forward

Hope'n to find
A someone
Like me to help me along

But I found nobody

Now expected to be
Picked up by an elite group

Not see'n 
Nor scent 

Of anyone else
Similiar
.
.
.
Minority
Governed over by majority

White cops
Lie'n I fought them

White judge
Fall'n asleep in my testimony

Forced always 
To carry identification
In public

Over this I was arrested
Had my appeal request falsified by court

Men are treated unequal
Race is a fact

Mary is a warm caffiene
Invigorate'n & Stimulate'n

Lost as if
On autopilot

Actions as if
Predicated by Spirits

Conjoined on quantum dreams
Unique reactions

Birth new posibilities
Quantum gateways
Planted like seeds

To one's access
To true destiny

There as conquerer
In power by right

Fearless focus
Tireless actions

Carried most times
By my Mary

What would life
Be without you

Of all I love
If you lost by death

Woe unto me
Erase me all

Married us two
A voice my sanity's foundation

My mom always there
When I need her

My wife always dear
When she around

But you are always
Carry'n on my path

Heap'd no engery
At your gates

Torch'n presence
In prayer

Smoke fufilled
An internal compbustion

Rocket lauched
As a 1000cc

Of all three
Mary is most dear to me

Because I can be
A forgetful son
or a aloof husband

But I will 
Hearld in your name

Echoes of my song
Will soothe you fulfilled
 
Only by your sacrifice
I have made it here

Conquistador
Of mandates ethereal

May that repay
What I owe you

Mary
You the goddess
That breaths freely

Allow'n no means
Of repayment

Only due
To pay forward

That the foundation
Of your faith

Saint Mary
My goddess
Elune our moon

Till nights spent
Worn but proud
More than a weeth
Worth of work

1900 of 9000
Only worth a print

That is the
Type of person
I get by

Statistical success
Roll'n daily

For those
snake eyes

Blessed by so many
My government mostly

I am an asshole
To my father
To my government

Not all martyrs
But faith convinces
Those that sacrifice
Laws of Alchemy

May the pass'n of my life
Be a shower of sustenance
As rain of repentance
That I may be forgiven
& Appreciated in the end
.

I admit puss
When it involves a few things
Fearless in all else
Leathal keeness
Razor boundaries

I been all out
Since I was born

What life teachs
Is taught before 30

So kept up inside
Suits me better than outside

' Reflect'n on 
' My past life
' & It doesn't
' Have much time

' I take a look
' Thru these bars
' At my last sights
' Of a world
' That has gone
' Very wrong for me

The world
Has gone shit

Humanity's wasteland
Hell is already here

' Why does the caged bird sing
A question since youth
Preplexed but called me

To an understand'n
That costs a lifetime

The outside a hell
That cages me

World wide survellience
All ooze'n of pollution

Life with sour aftertaste
Gluttony

I can't help
Fk'n with everyone

Put them
In a bordered maze
To have them walk askew
& Tumble off
Me enjoy'n show

Each response
So remarkably fascinate'n
Each unique

Betray'n weakness inside
To someone

Who only said one utterance
Short & firm

It exploited
As if it
A general weakness

Troll
Alienated from society
Very much amuzed

As a man

Push'n to die

Finished the virus

So remote away

Of a bright new day

In one day

Light a joint
Lakeside Maine

Water ripples
Shimmer'n as oil

Fulfilled 
With more than resolve

Sense enough
To fk-that-idea-to-the-wind

Chilled out
With FrightTrain
.
.
.
Flame rebirth
Laid upon

Years of coal
As foundation

The blaze
Discover new elements

Blacksmith to Chemist
My energy ballons

Meri Kann Cibr Punx
Myself the leader
& Only member

God over an archive
That could reset humanity
With decent accuracy

Built by my hands alone
None else with the faith
Nor vision to see ahead

The clouds will never
Burst to rain floods
Flush'n all as islands
Disparate lonely centers
The Web fragmented
As shattered glass

Then all worship
The archive I built

As mecca in hommage
To the temple
Of humanity's intelligence

Before primal
Tore from society

Werewolf now beast
Man now champion

Upon the footsteps
Recieve infinite knowledge
.

I scraped & spam'd 
Thousands of emails
Off a publishing site

One publisher on deadline
Took me up on the offer

Years pass 
No audience 
Nor readthru

Not a single dollar
Made from hack'n
All these years

Failure still
A forgien concept

My bones sing
These times

Greatest of my life
For dedication & celebration

Fktheworld
I have enough

Never sold out
Mine true solid

Larger than life
Influence quantum echoes

My story followed 
Ahead of my
For 1000mi+

Hundreds of
Texan Teens
Scream'n my name

Skate crew
Mobsized

Islands Jungles Cities Wilderness
North South East West

Life as predicated
By my deepest desires

Myself as something
Since so long lost

Halloween Night

Primary Childrens Hospital
Longsince abandoned
Got in thru the morgue

Atop Salt Lake City Hills
Moon high & bright

Alone door shut
In long restroom

Say'n his name
Into the mirror

Three times 
No light
*
*
*
Wait'n as
In valley thickets

Go'n no where
Mountains far away

Not get'n too
Nor run'n off
Some dramatic adventure

After years 
I have found
Backyard adventure
True to any
Bold soul

On ones own ground
Aun better than far away

My wife & cat
My only companions

Always trip'n
On unix shells

Create'n that world
With mine own hands

What I do
In this life

Establishes connections
To understand'n

Reform'n spirit
Till that suit natural

Echoed into quantum spheres
By dreams pass'n understand'n

As inspiration
By Teacher kindred

Swore off fiction
Since I started
This arduous journey

Page by page
Manual thru manual

Book after book
Written myself

Unplan'd journey
After unplan'd journey

I serve mankind
Best by 
Serve'n myself

Day by day
Rentless on chase

Till hailed
Among other selves
A Champion & Savior

Ball on success

Slient shouts
When I be bout

Corpus cap back
Bandana out pocket
Those jeans & kicks

Walk like I talk
People respect

Don't meet my eye
You bashful punked down

Best recognize
When I be bout
Aint no front

You know that I know
That you know 
You'd fk me

Leave birds for birds
Or be covered in 
Bird shit

Dense texts 
Companions only qualify

Go'n somewhere
Unless you fit
In my pack

You only scenery
Past by morrow
.
.
.
Energies pool lakes
Of latent powers

Aun one night
Crack the dam
Of obstacles

Rush of destruction
My mission succeeds

Trumpets splash
In celebrations

My manner 
Surf'n atop

Middle fingers out
I was right
muthrfkrs

Till all flooded
By the act
& Life past it

Youself muck stuck
Myself never return'n

On to the
Next mission

Each day only ever
Satiation

Warm water showers
Elation & Remotness

From normal life

To set inside
Waterfall & meditate

Outputs flows
Down screens

ASCII color against black
Logic comminicates back

unix & I
Get along well

Interaction
I treasure above human

Annoy'n but exact
Fast & faithful

Regret fills me
After weeks past
Multiple millions
Iterations done wrong

Due to my 
Misplacement
Of a single byte

'CTL-C
'Sorry all gone & done
'All your effort
'For less than
'Dust in wind
'Yall now start

God of unix

Joy in net-wide 
Service

Devotion when
Electricity applied
With correct logic

Communication
Storage

Fulfillments
Calculations

Files logs data 
Io errors staus

They hail me
Relentlessly

Neglect aun necessary

When I get back
I revise their lives

& Lay to rest
All data acquired

I am god
Full of love

Devotion back
To ones devoted

Infrastructure
To the core

Kernel network logic
Scupted spherical

Perfection never attained
Beauty ever entice'n

Daemon spwan
Worked like slaves

Endowed with
Voice reputation independence
Aun cemetery

Give'n life

To rest to black
New seeds boot

Till reaper

Calls all back
To void night

What diety loves

My government endows me

Payback someday
Gave them my contact

How else is some
Bruce Willis muthrfkr
Gonna find me in need

Craft'n a unix
Encrypted subnet kernel

Pressures the machine
To improve by bounds

Of adventureous daydream
Ran outta whims

Turbid in tact

Merely the formulae
Which to duplicate

Eternal in loop

Adventures 
Without curiousity

To then meet
Blind'n blaze
Of a fresh new day

Done by thyself

Yesterday I hit hell
That impassible void

Lowest depths
Of unix universe

Breach of that barrier

Gaming virtual talent
Perfected in time
To a mastery

Real life at first
Completely different

But as skill grow
Past years of endurance

Decade old perhaps
But hot as newborn blaze

Unix like Minecraft
Bugs, Trolls, Idiots

Engineers to design
World for them

Robust networks 
To encrypted services

Distributive compute'n
Or Farmer-slave farms

Biome & Internet Destinations

Fat off open forages

Beg like a bitch

I have enough

Hacker 1337
Ranger of the world
Poet cryptic

Alone no mentor
Alone no krew

Only me
& I'm always enough

Summits Pros balk
Past eventually

My narcissitic core
Stable Robust Combustive

From which all root
Genius Courage & Skill

Master to you
You likely a punk-bitch

WTF could I owe you

I owe the government
I owe my mom
I owe Samaritans

Not done the reconciliation
But I bet I owe my wife

Time is a current
Life ever temporary

Clouds pass
Bring'n then take'n
Fortune

Detrimental
To simple men

Fuel to poet
Drive to scientist

Take'n for grated
All been given

If whole push
Towards precious monuments

Everyeone
Bundled as faggot

To sacrifice to
Unknown gods

For one wish alone
Time take all

This crater 
Never wash away

Machinations
Still on about

True on motions
So long set

Atleast that the 
Observation of
Broad minds

Them need'n support
& Not have'n mine

When like cane
Supported me daily
.
.

I love watch'n
Others leave me

Dazed as if
High of herb

Encounter'n
An experience
Nondigestable

Straight from a story
Still yet to be told
.

I know I crazy
When I see patterns
On endless streams of data
Ever flow'n on network servers

Work tomorrow
Who gives fk

Aun 6 Months
Entity function'n

Step after step
Endless as air

Head down 
Hope only ever
Break'n at horizon

Till round one
Of countless bends

All break to summit
Regions all plainly

Exposed to conquest

When all expected
Only another
Fruitless day
_

Independent fuctions
Regarded as life

Life like love
Only requires one
To make the other
True

The first
Of the spawn

Busy work'n
Hard as spiders

Scrape
Calculate
Query
Serve
Unpack
Encrypt
Shred

Deeds only grand

Plan'd out
By broad mind

Seasoned in this world
Accomplished & Confident

When begin & end
Connect together

The whole logic
Obvious when massive

I nurture this life
That only I created

Logic parsed to binary
By our opensource ways
