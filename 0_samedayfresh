El Botanico

A cat refuge
Made out of a
Deep wooded
Deep city park

A place
Only in fantasy

Much can be derived
From this society

Buenos Aires
Valentines Day

The people stroll'n
Lovers in hand

Romance unmatched
A spirit lost
To the modern world

Yet in this
Remote land
Held treasured
.
.
.
I have gathered firewood
All night with a few people

The latest was when I went to Ottawa
For the World Unix Conference BSDCan

Headed to camp in the woods
For the night

I met a homeless
My age
By the homeless shelter

After buy'n weed
He decided to come
Hang out with me
Hope'n to hitch out with me

I warned him it might get cold
But he was Canadian

I taught him how to make fire from a candle
From wet wood

He taught me how to keep a fire going
Until 4am constantly gather'n wood

I gave him $20 to go get more weed
To meet later at McDonalds

Mayhap it was the freeze of that night
Covered in my second layer clothes
He suffered the cold Canadian June night

Or mayhap he couldn't resist
Spend'n that $20

Either way
I never saw him again
I'd get to Newfoundland alone
.
.
.
If the govt is mad at me
Well I accept the consequences
Of live'n a lawless life

It is a part of me
I wish never taken away

Tho I may at times take liberty
In the freedom of my wishes
.
.
.

Dazed & exhausted
From the long haul

When vacation
Is the exact opposite

Now back to the grind
Find it a rest

As the level ground
Is rest from mountain elevations
.
.
.
Most these muthrfkrs
I interact with

Can't fathom
The man I am

Tie'd out
Money at the brim

I just hope
They aren't blind

Cause my eye
Punk out garanteed

Perfected since
I was hardly a teen
.
.
.

The drunk guy
At the local dive

Talked a bit
Of shit

But I found it
Quite the complement

' Dark mysterious stranger
' In the corner

I just gave him
My look

Texans
Never tolerate disrespect
.
.
.
Not a holic
To anything in life

Mayhap
Only the pleasure

Of take'n in
The moment
As if it the last

Peaceful
Is the heart
That die fulfilled
.

Friends & Love
Can be lost long
But will always return
To those who seek

Of all I meet
Not till I returned home
Did I find

Kindred
Sprinkled by Destiny

To waypoints
Of how one should be
_

Many songs writ
& Stories told
Of my deeds

Elijah my closest cousin
His deeds
Only told in first person

Which are equal
In comparison
To my own

How is it
That in my long seek
I find you again

Alone as when
I was a child
Now alone
As an adult
Back home
_

I always disrespected my dad
He would say he was the shit
But he only ever rolled with family

I thought that
The lamest fault of all
Teen in my social height
_

Now with fewer friends
But still friends

Elijah was the only one
I still cared to see

We talked
As I haven't for unknown years
About the same topics
I'd shame my dad for do'n
_

Old age
I know now

Is learn'n
Your dad was right all along
& You played the fool
.

Cuban cigar
Sized blunt

31st Birthday
Hot boxed
With JJ & Elijah

I choked out first
Break'n to chicken
As I rolled down my window

The smoke
A giant cloud
Deompress'n

Over the houses
& To the sky
_

Codine coated blunts
Put me to shame
Tap'n out

Back to back blunts
Put me to shame
Tap'n out

Back to the streets
For my birthday
& I got played the pussy
.
.
.
Wife & I
At different
Strengths & Weakness

Under pressure but
Took me off the mountain

In admiration I said
' I would have
' Flip'd the fk out
' Fk you, fk this, fk everything

She replied
' I work better
' Under pressure

Her research paper due
That night

' Send over what you have
' & I'll help you
I told her in grattitude

I opened her email
It only contained
The teacher's prompt
.

Die Hard 4

If you gonna be 1337
Be loud mouthed

& One day
Some Bruce Willis muthrfkr

Bust in to say
' Let's save the universe

& I'd know
I prepared all my life

Batman knows
Robins
Know their place

A ride to die
Kind of muthrfkr

This wave
Till its end

In hopeful
Total Washout
.
.
.
All I need
One look
One memory

Then they know
Muthrfkr cast
Apart from the rest

Your reaction
A tired route
Tho to you
Unique it seem

Off the wall
Blackest of sheep

Lucifer to gods

Try to understand
I'll laugh at your tumble

White razed black
Latin grown Mexican

American at the core
Not that fat phone type

Southern raised
& Never tolerant
When some muthrkfkn
Northerner think they shit

Fk this federation
Rember the cause

Rebel against
Two Faced Tyrants

Minorities proclaimed free
Tho cuffed they ever be

Not for
Womanize'n

For ball'n over
Weak

You down
Cause you want to be

I up
Thats where

.

Approach'n fear
Fk that

I do what I do
But  never what I'm scared to doo

Shit I been against
Many things I done

But shit its proof
No Fear
After it is done

My first
High school friend
Anothny
' El Feo
As say his family

He & Benny
Us all watch'n
Pulp Fiction

My mom bust in
At the start
Of the ass rape'n

My mother see
Aun Snuff
To me
Know as 'Disney'
The only high schooler
Only allowed to watch 'G'

I could a
Explain'n this an actual movie

Fear fk that
Rather their speculative eyes

At us in 10s
Rise'n from the live'n room floor
Past 10 skip'n school

Never a single female

Those seniors you

Offer'n to cruise
Skip'n school to roll

Northside
The side where we
Can only ever be

So if you aint black
Or those visit'n people
Its too aparent

Pull with their
Old grandmother
Holds strong there
.
.
.
Never disrespect me

Texan
Or Narcissism

I'm gonna call you out
To deal undiscolsed bargins

Cause I'm old
Too old

The best day
To come is Today

Call'd out a muthrkfr
In a mexican bar
Defiant against a nest

Sure as shit
I'm call you out

Your bitch
Cum think'n of me

If she ever sees me
Thats just
Who I be

Not handsome
Manly

Cause she know
Imma fk her-
Like my last

Only to my wife
Like every night

Teach'n these
Slovenians

At their bar
They say
' All we got is AKs
' Not good for long distance

I laugh
' All I care about
' Is whats in front
' Of me up to that railway
( 30 feet)

' Revolvers are best
' Cause you know
' All you got to do
' Keep on that trigger

Shit those
Are'nt meant for reload'n

' But if you expect
' To use more than 5
' You ain't live'n
' Much longer anyway

Americans always
Know their guns

Homeless
To baller

Not have'n excess
But ball'n with
What is given

There the alchemey
Of Midas touch

Life sweet
In American Saturation

Ball'n
But in reality
Give'n back
To the streets

I know the joy
Of a big tip
& If I can do that
I will

The jackass to most
But value overrides

24
Life to up in Arson

Nothing but what
In my pack

None
Not even me
Know what part
Of the states I'm in

No cell
Only a CERT

My back
Guarded only ever
By my arms

Tom cat
From society

Money thrown at me
Cause they know

I know wassup

I throw it back
At the ones I like

Money
Aint shit to me

Where you can
Blunt back to back

If I'd known
My siloette at 31
V & Curvy
In prime state

Old age
Might not have
Become the monster
It is to me now

Shit pants
Happens in adventure

But back out
Unable without assistance

Deserves
The death that comes

But not all
Get what they deserve

Some streched
To torment

Faith
Keeps my chin up

The weight
Of the legacy
Of my past
will secure

Farewell Blazed
In glory of the moment

Light of Heart
To see Truth
.

Virtual Reality
The realm of gaming

To experience existence
As one wishes

As a female
Nightelf champion

I teased
Christina's boyfriend
That he played a girl

He replied
' I'd rather
' Stare at her
' Ass all day

I always
Carried a briefcase
In high school

Cutoff Jincos
& Colored mismatch socks

Colored hair
& Noose wallet rope

In the black school
Northside Hillcrest

I always
Ride to die

On those razor
Edge life styles

Life writes stories
As vivid as pain

In that
Complex & Incomprehenisble Way

Those who ever
Crossed me
Lived in anxiety

Those who ever
Accepted my friendship
Meet me in happiness

They knew I was
A certain kind of
Muthrfkr
Tho garanteed not
The treacherous kind

In any
Social sect

I have explicitly
Been taken in
As a rare oddity

Too blinded by interest
Too see my
Blatant anti-qualities
.
.
.
Cultivated
Perpedicular to society

Adventure unfamiliar
In a net

Words outshined
By the glare

Hackers
Clicked away
_

Against the grain
Black sheep

Often I suspect
This my only motive

Or that it be
Excellence when unguided

Many paths
Numerous choices

Where whim meets wisdom
Subconcious instincts unearthed

Alone
Cleanroom

The reaction pure
Wastes of reaction

In that earthly circle
Action feeds another

Off what is
Left unused

To be always as able
But never squandered
.
.
.
Codine coated blunts
Never again please

Spliffs only smoked
When I forget how much
I dislike them

I enjoy saturation
Of one thing alone
.
.
.
Time precious
Statis maddening

Give me the
Liberty of meaning

To cause movement
On the roll of life

Restrict me
In a space of no progress

Mutex Locked
Waiting that seems forever
.
.
.
Alone
For the first day
Of a month

Doing
What I always do
I guess I love my life
.
.
.
Losers
Rejected by all

Those
My people

Us taken each
As an other

Know'n the
Other is
Okay with what

Not fake'n
It along
With the rest

This is
My legend
No delays

You serve the story
Or we go our seperate ways

Not selfish
Understand'n
Earthly ways

Forced
Execrements shit
Only flies like
.

Not the man
Of my city

That time passed

Ranger
Off the grid

In forgien lands
Full of fear

First time
O'r The Atlantic

Never heard
Of the city before
Vienna

Austria
Think'n they spoke Austrian
The entire time

Slovenia
Made me realize
I knew nothing of Europe
When I seen
It existed on a map

Ljublejaba
What kind a
Odd place is that

When you travel
On the whim

The city desolate
All the words
In that odd austrain language

I aint blind
I know whats up

Shit I always been
Scared of what
I regardless do

Put'n myself
Ever in position

To have to live
With hard choices

You might be cold
Shit'n no paper
In the same
Consistency as their coffee
+

My simple theory
' If I can see it
' I can get there

I told that man
Us alone near
Secluded military lands

His look of
Unsettled incredibility

Due to my
Assured certainty

Tho the storms
Centered on the mountains

Never permited me
To actually test
That theory
.

Trieste Italy

A german man asked
' How do you talk with people

When he learned
I didn't only knew Spanish

' I guess I don't
' Talk to many people

I casually negociated
With the train ticketeer
Him aside have'n
Offered to translate

The path laid out
To Innsbruck

Thru Northern Italy
In May blizzard

Pass'n a bum
Past 10

In a city
I understood only
As a small mountain town

Cold & Rain
Him huddled under
A shop ledge

Those you plead pity
Always fills me with disgust

Cold & Rain
My huddled wet
Under the trees

Hammocks are terrible
In mists
.
.
.
I only do
Lotta talk'n

Cause that why
I walk

Meaning for me
Is pride earned

Fk humility
I legit

Savor our moment
Cause you will
Always remember it

A unicorn
Mixed with a stray
Mangy mutt

Magesty only in the smile
Glad for each new day

Some people are
Too stupid
To see such things

These I have to
Explain myself
Which puts me
In awkward positions
Which I'm entirely
Accustomed too
.
.
.
The internet
Has isolated us

Islands
Alone

Early 00s
I met many people

Now all interactions
Without bonds
.
.
.
Every summit
I find
Lonliness unmasked

Were one thought
Pinnacles of debat

Forgotten grounds
Inmutable boulders

Trees all
Alpine runt

As if you betrayed yourself
Beguiled to a far away desolation

This the true motive
Under it all

Major players
In the unix community

Recognize me
As the loon half-baked
I embody

Deep & cold paths
Snow in proof
Of no other
.

Live today

'Like  its your last
'Or its your greatest

Live today
Only to remember

3rd attempt
To make ridge

Met with quick failure

You only ever
Need to suceed once

This time
Blunted Blazed & Ridgeside

They asked
Of my yoga

We performed
Sacrament

Beef Jerky
No water
Is never fun

Then the chug
Moutain Dew
In one hit

Sunrise pose
Inhale blunt
Rise exhale smoke

Blaine the choo choo train
Let smoke out
Only in small percentages
Inhale'n precentages of fresh
Hypervent out

Among blaze
We commited ritual

Solitary Ridgeside
Elune enshrouded
Late no light

All were blessed
With the cough

Lost deep
In foggyness
Of a lost state

Soul in
Perpetual Instability

Social smog of Failure
Too potent not to be fact

What strikes me hot
Above any understand'n

To others
Neutral Lukewarm
Spew from thy mouth
Away lunatic

But words
Keep flow'n

As long as my biches love me
I could give me a fk bout no hater

Im on that good kush
Imma ball to the day I fall

31 Aint so bad
Fair I see it shine
On everyone

Death I begin to fear
Greater with everyday

Life in that stillness
Caught of heart
As if all the universe
Needs a breather
For what bout to hit you

La Santa Muerte
Loves the surprised

She will catch you
& Your time slowed demise
Will be cherised

Fk Tomorrow
Natural path

If todays effects
Tomorrow so greatly

What greater proof
Do you need
To still do it

Sleep
I'm always an asshole anyway

My birthdays
Spent alone

Surprise Birthday
A wish itself

Alone on some
Forgien ground

But not that time
On that suicide
Ride down the mountain

I made it to Helena

A girl & friends
Greeted me a stranger
At a bar to celebrate my birthday
By word alone
But even such is powerful

Surprise
You aren't alone on your birthday

Tho it the expected outcome
Never been Montana way
.

'The quickest way
'Is not the straight path
'Of mathematics
'Karate

'Tai Chi
'To already be there
A mass of sticky hands

Believed it himself

Breathless moment
When a song
Is understood

Mayhap bypassed
Plenty before

Freddie Gibbs
'Just Tryin' Ta Make it

Birthed in me resolve
That succeed to Sneznik
A journey
That took many days

Against them locals
Aun to sneer
But I suceeded

Sneer me
I just smirk back

You
As the countless past

No where to find
To dance all up on
Mistaken faithless fks

Over the ear

Mayas well be speakers

Up on them streets
All in local cryptic

Bitches on the street
Gonna hear some

What I'd bring on you

Old women
Only need one look

To be told
To very depths

What I be bout

Only ever in tales
Never real to fk you

Then I come in
Roland of Gilead

It ends up being
My decision

Boxer Mickey
'Women make you weak

I dont allow you to ask
It is the regret of denial
That will haunt you everlasting
For have'n not taken
What had been demanded of life

Drama
Excrement of Society

My love is honest
Regardless of my love

That to me
Is my only definition

My sins
Swell unattended

Till

Launch in 
Avalanche

Never resist massive forces
Sith manuevers the momentum

Detriment to push past 
Until it overflow to power

There to summit
A new stage of life

Dick

The name my mother gave me
& She knows me best

As a Ranger
Of mountain realms

It is my obligation
To inform nonlocals

'This a flash flood area

'Stay close with your friends
'Moutain Lions live here

Helps ruin the day

.
I process data
Pretty goddamn good

This buys over
My odd personality

Task monumental to most
Solved offhand

From my true task of the day
In my day-to-day march to 1337

Aun physical tasks
All mainly machine type algorithmns
.
.
.
A Nation
Bent on 
Worldwide surveillence

Doomed
To enslave itself

Adriatic seaside
I understood

America
The only fate
I seek
.
.
.
America
Bought only a traitor

To whistleblow
On its surveillent state

Not the confession
Of community neighbors
Busy in its subversive tasks

What a day
What a day

When only a Snowden
Cured our ignorant state

A much better hacker am I
& I not a Russian Spy

If the call rise
May it be for my name
Next time
.

Life is something
That comes & goes

At the end
I hope as
Pheonix I fly

All flame 
In sudden glory

Then to darkness
Of the night

'Fuck the world
I'd first seen this sentence

On my wife's chinese shirt
Fate's message

My catch phrase now
'Fuck the world

'Fk the world
'How did I mess
'It all up again
Often sentiment
That goes with
My excited smirk
Mania & Lust

Out there
In the world alone

That is what
I am best at

Let youth
Give me the momentum

To fly

Didn't belong anywhere
Bury me best right here

Event at the apex
Life horizons death

Faith
Where I die sacred

It is death
That tells

A man's Tale
.
.
.
Like my Mission
Like my Appalachian Trail

Never once believed
I'd make the end

Now with all false faith
Stripped from me

Failure
The sound of Nothing

After my words
Are distributed abundantly

I just keep write'n
As I kept preach'n & hike'n

Cause the means
Is my favorite part
.
.
.
Ball'n
Is know'n 
How to ball with nothing

Once you get that ball
All well known

Just give me a little
& I flaunt all over it

But like a new car
It gets old

Tom cat life
Streets fk'd up

.
Skills
Matter most in life

Relationships end
Drugs can't create

Money flows
Best fresh like water

Things
All the things I need
I dont really like

Hammock, tent, pack, laptop
Sleeping bag, jacket
_

Been so cold
Thought I was die'n

& Those times
Are greatly overshadowed

What fate
Keeps me upon
Wings of luck

To this day
I knew I hit black

But my peanut skull
Uncracked

I remember my head hit'n
Asphalt at 70mi+

Motorcyle continue'n on
40 Yards

To smash into
A complete total
Against concrete wall

Due to
Wet damn leaves

I always met people online
It is more awkward than it may seem

But I am used to awkward
Home thru the cold rainy wasatch pass

When I got home
I couldn't take out my keys

Been at that always

Child read'n books
Child endure'n adventures

America
Police State

Life under powerful sects
Rule hardhandedly

Administrative Thugs
Unioned Federally

I believed
I would leave

But American is what I am
American to whatever end
.
.
.
Wrote a book
Published a bit

But most I can ever do
Is leave it on a trail

To the side
Underneath what looks to be
A few days drift
.
.
.
Merit means most
To most

I merit much
But now isn't the time

To sidetrack myself
On the petty run for payment

All I need
Is what I can make
A story out of

Now it is an
Archive Mainframe

It has been
Motorcycles 1, 2, 3, -> 4
Osprey pack
1lb Down sack
Work Tie
Scripture Set
Converse Shoes
Trek'n poles

Just give me whatever
I'll figure something out

Appalachian Epic of 3SHOT
MKRX Systems

A hacker weekend
Can change a
Monumental Project

Into a well & done
Right off the back

Plenty of
Coffee

Plenty of
Bud

Guided as if by
Poltergeist hands

Something passing through
As with one last chance
To make amends
That they channel
Through you

I have given
All I had to give
To everything in life

Of this
I am at true peace
.

Went back home
To Corpus Christi

At my old
Neighborhood grocer
Down the street

It looked like a
Crack Town

People stare'n
Why is he here

It is fascinating
How some things
Never change
.
.
.
It was years
After the incident

Camilla told me
'Yea you did
'You flew over the car

'Oh yea
After the distant memory
Of me fly'n over the car
Fifteen - Twenty feet away
Dazed & Confused
Find'n my way back

All I cared at that moment
Was that Camilla was okay

& That thank god
I decided prudence
Against go'n wild
Down the street
From that light

No Man is an Island

Doubtless John Donne
More alone than 
I could ever concieve

Surrounded by love
& acceptance by
All those around me

Bought by my childhood
Spent in seculsion

Solitude is all 
I ever seeked
Me vs them

It is hard
To accept

Unique
An kinldy adjective countless
Used to describe me

Not till my Mission
Did I understand utter lonliness

Blocked from communication
With only a jackass
Companion for company

Not in Mexico to baptize
On Crusades of Faith

To find who 
Call to fate for faith

Mayhap bypassed
In the ardour of work

Only ever walk'n
Belt too hot to touch

Whiteshirt & tie & kakis

I am just an 
Odd type of person

But I don't see
Much life in any other way
But completely devoted

I read much
Focused on much

Before the mission
I studied this book
Along with the 
Life of Christ

The 10 Commandments
Ten ways a society
Must live in order to survive

Past times after
Empires crumble lost

Tho themselves
Once their slaves

One commandment
Alone for worship

'Dont take
'The name of thy lord in vain

Which I became to understand
The religious backdoor
For control over society

As the Old Testament testifies
There is generally 
A good reason for it

You should not take
Another nations woman

Because soil
Determines the offspring

But which was unheeded
& Led to one of many downfalls

But the ancient way of life
To live as one simply devoted

It is worth meaning
To perserve past hardships

To awaken today
& Revolutionize your life

Worst is starve to death
One is assured to live at peace in

Literally shit out
Of all your luck

Who trusts the uknown
To pay up on credit owed

I got enough loans
To know that never
Works out as planned

So best have a good time
& Help others along the way

Hard choices
To redefine a life

I promised
Would have beautiful ends

John Appleseed
Knows he will never harvest

Know'n fate will take care
Of a few of the countless

To bring 
Appease love shade stability
For generations to come

All worth
If only for two

Tho to what end I can not know
The false hope of a sour granny
Or the sweetness of washington dry

Sow'n is all
I ever really want
To ever do

No worries of justifications
When that a physical impossiblity

Faith not abide'n
The laws of physics

Miracles no science 
Can be sure to define

So I left
A year & nothing

As if so busy
I never stopped to question

In the end 
Accept'n gratefully 
The void of nothingness
A vaccum that gorges all
To fill itself
With all manner of interesting

Faith I bore
Know'n the truth had left
But would one day
Come back around

Faith I have 
On my own found

In a life
Among bretheren

Whether
Physical or intellectual

Leave'n to posterity
Too great to be
Measured in generations

This book on a life
In a manner I hoped
Myself have'n had to recieve

I am 
adventurer hacker poet

& I don't care
Which one of you
Muthrfkrs know it

No man is an island
Did you follow me?

See your way thru
All the bull shit
& Hold the pearl
That is my wisdom

Or like all I met

In horror
Like disgust'n guts
Let it slap to the ground

Better covered gutterside
Under preferred sight of trash

& Thank god
You are all assholes like me
But much less deserve sight of it
Than to consume it greedily

Peaceful & pleasant
I walk faceless

Prince of Archives
Since '14

No longer
About file lust

A greater need presents itself
Independence of Humanity

Our anonymous right

But I look 
To the poor beasts
We eat or slave

A fate
I chose myself

But not one
I'm will'n to
In debt to posterity

Still I affirm
This fate I deserve

The mechanics of its motion
Longsince set

Trump Election
The thunderbolt sent by god
The universe or whatever

To crack open the earth
To be filled by our dead

Rattlesnakes
Expect & accept death

Death is the meat
Of its substance

Nobly
It finds death itself

& Sure as shit sticks
Better decapitate

Cause even four hours after death
It may get chance to strike death
Turn'n victor to victim
.

Preparation
Not only hoard'n

Hone the keeness
Of wiley skill

Live it up 
While it lasts

Long life
Isn't most important

Only to be
How I be

Till its
The end of me

Remembered in thousands
Over thousands of miles

I know how to have
A very good time

Those who partake
Of its angelic levity

Are drawn to a wild
World of rambunctious action

Warrant'n a return
Only in fond memories

Afterlife only
Offers reunion

To me memories
Best left as statues & monuments

The old man looked at me
On the fork to the interstate
Still at a distance
He conceeded

Vegas
Days to find
A suitable bush

Of which to mayhap
Find a few hours sleep

Perfect
It would house one
Comfy cosy & secure
Against a concrete ledge

Too perfect
About to settle down
Old man walks up
Still at a distance
& I walk away

One shot
Of me ever necessary

Pure
As alcohol burns

Hits 
Fierce as Salvia

The one time
We meet
Like a needed 
But extremely uncomfortable experience

To any garden
Whose heart harbors my memory

You would swear

In latter days

If lost on valley floor
Smooth planes of ease
Stir alien horror

Path found

On a log
Over a ravine
Miles into the Jungle

Trapped
Like a bug in a web

Hang'n full suspension
Every joint
Held by a thorny vine

Confident as a master
In my compass skills

Naught till I was 
Well into the jungle

Discovered

Swept to the wind

With great respect

Inevitably
He took me
As an asshole

Like a slub on saint pattys

Soaked regardless of tarp

Much more admirable

'Fresh Carribean Rolls
'President Trump

'Of any person
'Ever in existence
'I'd take Trump

'Free to get wreq'd
'As we want

Those words the gateway
To its reality

As if the universe
Played passive
To hearts desire

Putin roll'n
Coked up with thugs

He didn't greet me
It wouldn't be proper

But he gave me a 
Swift look

That was as 
Solid & Invite'n
As handshake

Of the 2 tables
All out
But the 3 of us

50 Million dollars
& Both my kidneys
On the table

Hooked up & handled
By a Nobel Laureete

'All In
I called

Eyes on Putin
'Maybe I make you Russian
He laughed pleasantly
'Call

Trump who was only in
Because he put me to lose
For a few
Lost of interest easily responed
'Call

King of Clubs 
3 of Spades

Made me a millionare

They were ever out

Just jet'd in

The Laurette busy work'n 
But us three casually talk'n

Trump & Putin
Neverend'n 
About their adventures

Save'n the world
From ninjas to androids
To when they had to breach dimensions

Third-wheel those hours
My highlight

Before the end
I'd instigate 
The action
Of the end of the world

Into a night
That even they 
Would never forget

No pics or vids
Never forget'n
Trump crowned 
With a gold MAGA cap

On the grounds
OF the National Monument

At peak flight
Of Putin's 
Russia Special Dip

Myself have'n used a tie
To makshift a thong

Nudity for a reason
No one could remember

Run'n from hummers
Escaped into the 
White House

For a reason
None of us remembered

Have'n to get
Soaked in the thorny bush
Cold & naked
But do'n my best not to show it
In presence of King Putin

Thru a window 
President Trump left open
For this exact purpose

We hoisted ourselves
Leave'n blood streaks
That already got 
Distant dogs howl'n

Pass'n out
On the Presidetial Rug

Have'n to lay on
Last weeks hooker's towel

Wake'n up mid-air
Freak'n out
Tethered to a helicopter

Get'n pulled up
By Russian Special Forces

Grab'd inside by
Princess Ivanka 

On critical mission
To protect the life
Of our Princess

From the BLM squad
Sent by Barak Obamamma

Bullets flew
Spotlights ever accurate

I caught the blaze
As if on premonition

It at the corner of my eye
A laser weapon from space

As if pulled
I took Princess Invanka 
In my arms

Unhindered by the
Hopeless Russians

We lept
In a hurdle'n mass
Princess in arms

The flash of a beam
Gone but linger'n as a ghost

Erupted the helicopter
In blue explosions

Duck pond
Against air pressure
But the only option

There allowed the
The Princess unharmed
From land'n thru me

Saved by her
All muddy & fierce
As she unstuck
Me deeply embedded
In the muddy muck

Bruised
But nothing broken

Princess Ivanka
Carried me to 
A 10 hut village
Which became apparent
Was North Korea

In the local dialect
She asked for
Gum cigarette coca-cola
Cooper-wire & rubber gloves

She ladder'd to the powerlines
Took apart her ear'n
& Hack'd herself 
Into the direct line
Of His Majesty Kim Jong

A limo
Rated nuclear-bunker

Soon picked up the Princess

Inside the mod Cardinal
An immensity of a man
Put put his hand 
As I made way to enter

The man's hand
The size of my chest

I was too muddy
& The interior was sacred

'Go to Bangladesh
'To the Royal Sweet

A business card
Hidden by his massive fingers
Fluttered lightly down 
As he drop'd it 
For me to catch

The Princess cried
At the brisk part'n

A last micro second sight
Of beauty in memory

Precious past probabilty
Liable for fruad

After the sounds
Of the large engine
Lost in mountain passes

Dazed at the last 
24hrs Exactly
When I bumped into 
President Trump

North Korean Mountains
Starve'n in only a tie-thong

Excellent in health
Relative to my history

In Mexico
The women of the church
Would feed us our 2pm meal

An excommunicated witch
Was allowed to feed us

Grateful I never
Questioned her lifestyle

She would serve us
Extremely dark gravy 
Heavily spiced meals
Of mystery meat
My companions took
As chicken hungrily

Her golden serpent ring
Openly revealed herself

As she would lay down
That Sunday meal
_

Witchcraft
Lost to the North

Since child in tune with the streets
In their homes visit'n as church-people

None was even heard of
What is a staple of Mexico

Sects of this
Solitary religion

Dark Masters
In veiled niches

A plain putrid malice
They set up as shrine 
To their odd ways

Self-sacrificed to 
The Lord of Vengence
[[
Whom many erroneously
Voice as La Santa Muerte

A god who wishes
People die as they live

At least that is
My feel'n
]]
Craftsmen in Concoctions
Vile past beastly

Kept in jar
Buried or hidden

Or only some
Spetictude

At the home
Of the victim

Parts of bodies
Of vengeful dead

Sent enroute
To regain the flesh stolen

Enraged at the desecration
Are the belief of this craft

Or a small vial
Enough to stink
An entire nieghborhood block

Parts of almost every marketplace
Contained dealings for such

Hacker
In an anti-hacker state

Crocker the first hacker I knew
Lived alone at the 'park
Found 1337 thru insomnia
Book by book he read

The FBI expelled
Him from all universities

After Novell told the government
Who was told by the schools admin

Who was told by Croker himself
Report'n a hole that opened
Free access to the network

A typical story
In hacker circles

Omniscient power
Is power over ignorants

My country whines
Why are Russian hackers better?

As it maliciously treats
Wizards as witches

Inject'n my traffic
With packets

As they conspire 
To manufacture 
Probable warrants

So what is a 
Muthrfkr to do

That is too Texan
To leave america

Just try to be good enough
To get outta any situation

Russians may have 
Well fed hackers

But true is beauty 
Where naught else blooms

But in the end decided

I'd go to local university
& Use their gym

I saw legs
At a vend'n machine
In the distance

But I remembered in a panic
My milkshake needed ice
From the cafeteria on the other side

These weight gainers
Were slightly work'n

Think'n how I'd
Finally amassed

I see the legs
In the distance
Leave'n the vend'n machine

I caught up to her
Invited her too meet me

Narcissist
Since before
Narcissism was the state
Of earth's society

I revile them
Hack'n cheaply
In their imitations

Empty masks

Narcissim is deep
Conviction towards personal developement
Oneself as sacred shrine
Ones life as prophetic miracle

Sell out?

Like a priced whore

Of tactless & tasteless

Bask'n under shadow of Fortune
A mistress of treachery

Definitions of weak-minded fools
Who pretend to reconcile
Upon fantastical ledgers

Naught in life

Nothing is identical
Nothing can be aggregated
In such simple fashions

Myself a function
Ere a storm

Most laid waste
By the wake
Of my pass'n

Only the weak
Will fall

For better ways
For better seeds

In evolution
Of mother nature

So what am I?

I have brought oceans of darkness
To those I love

I have brought blessings neverend'n
To those I hate

Since I lost
My rudder live built me for

I been directionless
Since then fearless & alone

Guilty
As the come

Before Judge
& Other locals

'What do you plead?
She asked me

In a complex 
Internal debate

I forgot the options
& I arrived late

After instructions
& Kept there debate'n

Then finally said
'Guilty
Cause fk it I was

It was a spectacle
That everyone thought mad

'I kept on the back roads
'But I mean 
'Who wouldn't do
'What I did

Everyone like
Who the fk
Is this guy?
Is he on something?

If you think 
Me without my Jane
Is odd

Find you back ways
I will show you

The what you experience
Will be like a unicorn
Something alive tho now lost

Promise'n some insanity
Is gonna happen soon

Shit
If that aint prophecy

Then what is

What can I say
You aint real 'Murican
If you don't think you some prophet

Badass Preachers
Is that self-righteous white way

But you always 
Uncertain if its not true

To me in my life

Bitches money alcohol
Things

Fk that hell
I nothing
But I still got
A whole lotta
Everythang

This that
Only ever temporary

Seasons change
Along with seanery

Face this
Or face that

Never gonna
See them again

I only know
How to pass on
In pay forward
To other momentums
That mayhap
Circle to he
How prior blessed me

With some fresh food
Aun fresh water

Directions
Knowledge if this way or that

There are countless
As a missionary I can talk
To a whole lotta people

Easy for me to get
Karma to loop

If life is just
Destruction of possibilities

As we follow to reaction
As variables of lifes equation

Consequence
To consequence

Quantum reactions
Fireworks on a Texan Bay

Each descision 
Like thunder
It vibrates 
To exisitences
Of many spheres

Myself never less
Of a pyromaniac

Glory at it

Easy when wander'n

In circles
Or around

Complete in complements

Worked over & over

Comes as ready ways

No my fault
You come to my paths

Brainwashed
In certain ways of think'm

A toil harded seed
That will bloom
In an infection of sanity

A cloud of it
Fog to all

I want to be remembered 
For it all

That is the dark door
Well shined for all

As are portals 
To a new dimensions

Quantum to quantum
Tunnel opened & soul cast thru

To awake to new worlds
& Past realities

Voyered Dreams
Birth a scheme

Then as one
Thru the hack of salvia
Crouch'n jump'd thru

But he the dumbass
After the black of flame
Bloom the new evolved generation

To be grandfather
To entire eras

As the spring to river
Ones position inherited by eternity

A wanderer
Vagabond traveler

Suits my kind

Always get'n into
Some dire shit

Ready to let
More experience take charge

For better 
Or worse
But mostly worse

Their choice not mine
To let me drive

But I'll happily
Venture a bold way

An honor 
Not taken lightly

Many morn
In sadness of tragedy

Mayhap that experience
Evolve to meet prior gap

Sacrifice of honor
All graciously submit

Like the tired
Rattlesnake mother

After have'n seen
The escape
Of her young

Made her weak
& Made her meat

Ponder'n this alone
Too hot or too cold
Upstream Selway

A Theme

Just before breach'n
To true wilderness

A mother bust 
Into the open

I took off my rifle
& Aimed

Test'n only the movement
Never mean'n to fire

She simply stared at me
In what became
Obvious self sacrifice
As the young bust down
Cross & continue
She only afterward followed

Life is to my kind
Is one that should
Have those sorrows

To experience
Is what I'm about

In this new reality
23 Hit salvia
Greet'n a brother
I'd never met

Full of odd people
Hardly enough to adventure on

My wife is a blessing
My write finally intelligble
With goods to get by

Pleasant season far from
Winter long forgotten

I follow messages
In Fortune Cookies

No man is my master
& I got what it takes
To carry my own weight

Fk the police
My arch enemy

The sight of them
Fills me with vile hatred

My deepest wish 
To have power

To crush them slowly
Beneath my boots laughing

The source of this hatred
Found in no singular experience
It is a natural state of relationship

They hate me
I hate them

We recognize each other
For who the other is

Proofs are seen
In invisible traits
_

I been cuffed
Too many times
For me to recall
Even a fraction
& That is only
In high school

Still at 30 
Get'n cuffed 
On a regular basis

Fkn system
Sk my dick
I'll fill them
With something to cry about

But underneath that hatred
Is always a intrinsic love
As they wouldnt be them
Without people like me
& Vice versa

Senior year in advanced math
Cops came in demand'n me

Fortunately, 
This was one of the few days
That I attended class

They cuffed me in front of everyone
Then walked me out the entire school

All the teachers who respected me
Throughout my high school career
Finally confirmed what I be about

Not many even at Miller High
Get that kind of treatment

An honor I took
With head held high
& Smirk in my eye

Cause if you ever met me
That is Classic Richie
_

Or that one time
Re-enact'n Dazed & Confused

For the first time
Get'n caught by the PoPo

Lesson learned never hide
These police know these streets

Dumb muthrfkrs get juked 
Eazy enough on foot

Turns out I knew the cop
'I'm disappointed in you Richie

He wanted me to talk my way out
& Mayhap not get set to county
With the other sorry 3 that got caught 
Out of the many

My silver tongue
I hold sacred

It only to be used
To manuerver this or that

To tarnish it 
By beg'n out reprieve of punishment

I ain't scared of shit
Cause life is a story

& Thats the story
Of how I got criminal record
& Sent to County
Since I was a month into 17
*
*
*
I believe in myself
That I can make a difference
To save humanity from itself
& Retain its independent heritage

To oft
I see the ants
All labor & toil

Never excited
Only for the 
Greater good

Fkkkkkkk
That

I respect the independent
As one himself

They system naturally
Wants power to surpress

But what right
Do the governments of the world
Have to destroy borderless roams?

Man must have the option
Behave or GTFO

Humane expulsion to some unwanted grounds
Or submission for retribution

Oh that I lived
100 Years from now

To be labeled 
Disturber of the peace
& Sent to Mars
To make my way
With others convicted
Of the same crime
To establish 
A new frontier
With people 
I much prefer

Its all backup
I expect the law of demons
To follow the law of men
In that if 
Under the Influence
A pact is voided

If that doesn't hold true
A rite may have transacted
The triumph of liberty
For my soul

After two years on the mission
What could be worse

Whatever fate my dumbass digs up
I have faith the consequences
Of my carefully crafted actions
With ring true for generations

I can't sell out
Or by now I would have bought in

I care little for most people
I care little for most things

Most times only care about
The legend I swear in ink

10 Years as a writer
Almost half that as hacker

Never made a cent 
Of either pursuit

Fk the world
I have enough

A land to legend over
Some weed to keep me on beat

If I'm lucky
With someone like my wife

If I'm not in state
Of any state I desired

I spend most of my wake'n hours
Craft'n a plan B

Which due to such 
Nervous revisions in anxiety

Seem to be 
More of my suite

Make you Plan B
Better than your Plan A
& Life has twice the chance
Of work'n out as plan'd

hacker adventuer poet
All I got to do is just one of those

adventurer by season
hacker as mission
poet natural by typical richie rants

& If it fall
Ever only gibberish

Fk it

I only do what I do
Cause thats what I do

False judge to pitiful beggar
Keep away from me please

Much more pleasant
Is the presence of a hungry critter
Take'n up old pack food as treasure

Or bird in response
To calls made yourself

Blindness aun silence
Of mountain nights
Where one learns by feel

Path by foot's sole
Weather by feel's skin

Monkeys I finally understand
In their protective cages
Ever in petty squabble
Aun to death 
Throw'n feces at each other
Responsible of not of own actions

When a depended alone
He was a much nicer person

Early morn by bus
To get across town

On her other Sister

'Oh fk'n god
'Oh fk'n god

As the bus pulled up

'What WHAT?
The other shake'n out of her

Vegas 3rd day without sleep
Scooped up past midnight
With this guy from Defcon
So lost from reality
A girl spoke to him
At a bar & had to tell him
Explicitly she was a hooker

He said I could crash
On his hotel floor

At the room
His friend treated
Him like loose-brains

Misty the dickhead
Recounted how a stripper
Pleaded for a rescue

$1,500 & didn't get none
On that crumb chase

Head in-hands
Come'n to grips

What they do

I needed
No role model
Neither do you

Trust in yourself
Prayers are answered

To never surrender
Up a dream

Will pave your way
To consequence

Journey in mean'n
Gaze to Elune

Trust in yourself
& Forgive others

Life in Legend
Today next step

No man
Can serve 
Two Masters

Worship experience
Understand sorrow

Entropy effects all
Money Love & Skill

Why then
Do we live

This short time
On waves of
The Big Bang

Am I only 
Firework

To play out
In sporatic beauty

Defined in
Mathematical algorithms

Spark aun shine
For time ever
To look-back & see

Codes standardize actions

Machines live by code
Predicatability gives power
Impossible for humans

Power thru parallelism

Not a debate
Of success or failure
Only of heart

Heart is to do
Devoid of all-else

On stable ground
Not sandy shore

Of a life

Lived in the era

When you realize

You are the 
True devil

Devils or Earth

Each has different meters

Ms. Hawkins
My 3 year english teacher

She would tell use
Of her hated past

KKK threat'n to 
Gather & shoot
Our entire school up

Force'n Sharpton to cancel
Run'n for Presidency

Hate in a well-worn spot
Filled since the begin'n

Tho in relative peace
The pit too wide
& Too deep

America
I'm proud
We did our best

Regardless of failure

The soil too tainted
With the pollution of evil

The Civil War
Broke the Constitution
Of freedom to states
A Federation formed

Day-to-day disappointments
As neighbors turn
On their duty

The judge sworn
The leader elected
The general entrusted

All failed us
Start'n with the first

Humane logic cast off
For bias algorithms

Our country not been 
The Land of the Free
Since that war

Every war after
In breach likewise

Does history
Have answer to good decisions

Adventure 
Is my reason for being

Life as it comes
On far off scapes

Here & There
For that moment

Tho every where
Not much different
From anywhere

It is a small
World after all

Despite global times
It is the inheritence
Of curious types
To venture freely

Iquazu Argentina
Thru Jungle trail
With a local teen
We met bushwack'n

We went to all his spots
Spent the afternoon together

He wanted to become a pilot

Many friends in that program
I doubted him

But life is what it is
& If its not

It is to you that right
To prove the world wrong

Is or not
State of reality

I keep on my own
Never respect those who do'nt

Actions play out
Success only pollution

Fate a vortex tunnel
Pull'n me towards

Empowered by force of prayers
*

I felt bad
For worn torn victims

Now I understand
The lessons of sacrifice

A great cost
Certain rights lost

Spirit of Independence
Vanished since
Civil Wars lost

Never about slavery

Only about right
To remain independent

Forced down submissively
In matters that make
Men cannon-fodder

To our fall
From Democratic
To Communism

Lone wolf dies hard
Homogenus are marshmellos

Why does the cow live
Calm an unperturbed

From the reality
Of life around them

Life ruthless as Aquatic
Life ruthless as Jurrasic
Life ruthless as Infestation

Lush to barren
As the elderly
Eastern earths

The hives will
All feed upon
Each other eventually
When wrap'd round
The entire planet

Peak of

Computers were made
To do amaze'n things

Only one weak man
Against a omnipresent foe

If you didn't know

Total fk'd
That realization when
You vs pavement
As bug on windshield

But a man 
Has got to have
A good time thru it all

Has always been there
For me in the past

Bitch so much

Nothing less than
He who bites the 
Hand that feeds

Irratic & intense
Ever too into

The panorama of scope
Expansions of horizons

Encryption is bullshit
Math is the definition
Of a backdoor

Fk the police

One must understand 
The thugs of the enemy

Used by their masters
As dogs put in harms way
To extort people to order

Cry'n or laugh
Always in bullshit

With a cops head
Weasle'n this way or that

Daily life in danger
More than another profession

Used by municipalities
As tax collectors

7:30am Till 8:30am
I waited for him

Cop first thing of day
Come'n over cheerily

The police had found 
My motorcycle
Parked behind a building

Cop as enthusiastic as myself
We tried to re-engineer 

How the joyrider
Cut my wires

The officer was the sharp one
He helped me reconnect my wires

I never did
Thank him enough for that

Life is hard on them
I Pray they learn from it

I wouldn't be me
If there wasn't a them

I like being able
To cuss out a 
Muthrfkn cop
When one passes
From a safe distance

It lightens my day
To let out some hate

I aint ever seen 
A cop flip their shit
Without instigation

Social movements 
All focused against the police

Who follow codes
Made by legislative-powers

Dumbass generation
[[ The only person
Stoopider than a ignant

Is a privledged hipster
Educated only in

Go take your vendettas
To the right zone

Lay off 
Our grounds

Constantly on the run
From warrant to warrant

Cops aren't play'n fair

Remembered exemplified

Reveals its mind

Wonder

Defiance

Playfulness

How is it

As mere material?

Steak from animal
Wild who fkd-up

Not enslaved to eat
& Be eaten

Humanity as witch of
Hansel & Gretel

War torn future
May learn us

To respect all
What were offhandedly-lost

Freedom life & liberty
In distinctly different views

As States to themselves
Not sheeps of socialism

Confederates
Robert E. Lee

Lost what we
May yet win

I see as our future
Of what we rightfuly deserve

Cooked in our own ovens
Dividends of lifes-work
Given to the kids
We once herded as cattle

America Asia Europe 
Lost its liberty

Will South America
Take up the torch

Myself rejected
Silence shamed

But to me
I sense the calm of autumn

Fall a change of color

Rejection past familiar
The taste of it favorable
From it I feed

Zen & The Art 
Of Motorcycle Matinence

Not aimed to
Entertain nor informed

Continue thru thought

Have I been
Contacted by dead

Indisputable

But to life
Is for live'n

To the dead
Long & Gone

I say 
Farewell

Spirit like water
Must flow forward

Any earthly anchor
Festers poison

Life is a flame
It expands brightly

Which way no man
Will ever know

To shape it
Would be treason

Like extract'n paint
From a masterpiece

Too  intelligent
To conform

Sometimes intelligent
Enough to lead the masses
To understand why

I am good
Excellent in odd-ways

Tp see my destination
From my path is ludicrous

I way this or that
In a fluid thru

If fate 
Permits us time

You will never
Forget the lessons
I will teach

To grabs on ideas
Like strings of puppets

Play out logic
To your tune

A recipe cursed
With a heart of insanity

Once that door
Opened evermore

Cold gust
Chills for life

Fresh air
Tantalize'n more taste

Imbalance wonky
Enough to breath
Causality to paths

Man more than machine
In the rut it carves
For the future

Divergent

Many years dedicated
To the service

Right around in that time

Pray we all
Ignorant of our rewards

Touched by me

Ardent labor
On forgien earth

Mocked over & over

Labor Sacrifice Devotion
To all others

Now years later
I understand
Lessons learned

& Thank god
I banked it

Cause the Appalachian Trail
Was some by-miracle-only-shit

That is some far off time
To have some shit paid off

I bet god
Didn't think
I'd live to cash-in

But here I am
Independent & In-debt

Able to live
As I please

Achievements matter little
Unless the achiever known

Of how their life went

Grounds a common theme

Of critical decisions

Worth the effort till death

Bushwack'n thru Slovenia
Rollercoaster of a day

Got weed 
From locals at a pub

Passed thru
Weed cartel houses

Dirt paths led 
Different ways

Path sides protected
With military ambush pockets

Hummers at times
Go'n this or that

Sure
This was a 
Russian Invasion

I nearly shitmyself
When Hummer full of soliders
Roll'd up behind me

I cut deeper 
Into the woods

I heard something
Track'n me in the woods
Myself on dirt road

After time
I went to investigate
Near to the thicket

Responded a 
Crinkle of advancement 

The threat of it
Openly to me

I cut thru 
The fk out of there

The action of it
Resembled a man
Use'n knife to hunt

Fly'n a mile 
In a fluster

A giant siberan dog
Comes up on me
Before I can react

Collared & Friendly
Only the only civilian car
I'd seen since I entered the woods

I met a man 
At the mouth
Of the woods

Who informed me
This was government land

& Great fears calmed
He also laughed
About the dog
As if the dog his
Which he never told


Cut'n thru a
False church
Nested against the woods

It merely the
Veneer of a steepled church
In reality a garage

Great open hilltops
In military arrays

Barren but ready
This all woods

Dispite the miles deep
Dogs howl'n behind

Which but me on edge
To the howls 
At the hilltops

Myself below
Past dense thicket

Trek'n poles
Allow'n me over
Normal limits

To plantation-esk lands
All without electricity
Over odd boulders
Splattered by massive amounts of bats
Over a creek bridge
Past a borded up house
That was well-maintained

GoPro wack'n the fk-out
& Never after work'n

To miles cross'n a highway
To a town
Then to the rails

Double tracked
Back to the town

A howl was heard 
At the crux of the road

The howl was then
Heard in direction 
Of the tracks

I spent the
Cold rainy night

In a homely bustop
Against the church

Right around the corner

Thud from a long-fall'n mass
That hit in the alley ahead

Ear's tell'n me
It fell from the sky

Trek'n poles affront
My back to wall
Face to entry
Ready to get fk'd
By Slovenia Vampires
That tracked me 
With werewolves

'eeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhh
Came a cry of agony past human

Heart stop'd
The future too intense
To care any further

The wall the side
Of a church monestary

Fortune placed me
Securely

I was able to nap
Off & on in rare spells

4:30am Awake
Local wake'n
To his farm duties

A barrage of accustaive meows
Began to emerge unappeased

Have'n been left out 
All rainy night

After have'n believed
So assuredly of something

It exists
Evermore

Russians Werewolves Vampires
Can life still surprise me?

With 3Chop
Top of bushwacked hill

We met a man
He drew me a map
That was perfectly accurate
Up until the part
Of get'n back to the trail

Possible suspicion
Grew further 
By the recent horse tracks

Our position 
In a real-fkd position
If shit went
As bad as it could

So to be sure
We bushwacked up
This mountainside hill

Wait'n almost an hour

Prolonged intense

Till heard asid
A light scuffle
Followed by
The snap of a twig

Heart stop'd
Eyes wide

I farted

Break'n that tense silence

My sister look'n back defensively
~That one is totally on you

That was the time
She understood I went crazy

But to me
A small sidetrack
Worth the various redflags

Damn

I know

We have access too
Are heavily adjusted

Hungry & not have'n

To stay on course
Venture'n till end

Victory in echoes
Of futures to follow
Learn mean'n to being

If a pussy-ass muthrfkr
Caught as prey surrounded
Cry out in plea for help
Learn then what one really is

When shit hit fan
On my masterplan

Furthest thought
Be beg'n like a bich

Get'n on top
Takes all one has

Failure is a 
Muthrfkr

When I return
Back to civilization

Like a stray
You know had
Longterm struggles

Almost as often
As I fail

Are faces in shock
At the sight of me

All fked up 
Maybe bleed'n

Pop'd out of
Portrayals heretofore
Only of immagination

Remote darkness
Pop'n out impossible

Materialized from
Unhabitable remote zones

Such blessed sight
Draws a enlonged lip
To meet my eye

Brash boasts notorized
To what I did succeed in

Failure 
Falls to tolerable allowance

2nd Saturday
Of Fall 2017

Broke further
Til unfamiliar paths

Hours soaked legs
Where gale frost

With winters vengance
Warning of what
Is yet-to-be

Further I climbed
When I thought
I'd be descend'n

Snow over'n 
My past tracks

I retreated
Know'n to stop
Meant possible death
This high ridgeside

Hands about to give
Wounds from numbness

Beat'n to learn
Never underestimate a mountain
Even the most familiar
So high up
Law yields to
Boundless etherium

The boast of my heart
Fills my sails to go
But I must know
The limits of my craft
.
.
.
I been stranded
Near a 13000ft
Idaho summit

Hitch'n on road
All caught
In cold front

Alone stranded
Know'n with no
Sucess within hours
The effort would turn life threatening

The rancher picked me up
Offhandedly
Tow'n horse in back
Brag'n about his 
Cowboy rodeo son

I don't he ever understood
What a hero he was to me
.
.
.
Day-to-day experiences
Are were true treasure lie

Open sentinel eyes
Vigilant to pounce

To those are laid
Beauty of boundless things

Inside journeys
Begin with preparation

Finally since moved in
Almost 2 Year ago

I the throne room 
In total order

Ever since the
Hacker spirit left

Open books highlighted
Manual pages & reference texts
Computer parts large & small
Candlewax overspewed everywhere
All in mid-swing project

The place plastered
As HAQR

Hopefully as weeks go by
This throne will be plastered
Among the same in reknewal
.
.
.
The sin of arrogance
Pays in full as all

Half-Cocked
Think'n it full
Get caught as bich

When fate turns
A real muthrfkr
_

Humility to know
One has gone far
But the journey
By hidden turns
Rises ever higher

One must have prudence
To be able to retreat
To evolve and move on
Up again as before
Or to a side anew
.
.
.
I appear
As mangy stray

Clutch'n something
Too obnoxiously precious
To be real

To others this
Tacky display

What prince of men
Aun Prince of Archives
Would go about in
Such weatherworn rags
.
.
.
My inspiration
Hits with
Potence of forefathers

Submissive my tongue
Presents the gate
To your path

Tho as strangers
We meet

In your eyes
Revealed the struggle
The decision to
Ever enter it

Gates closed
Gates opened

Doors
A beautiful thing

Whether taken
Or left unanswered

In that Native
Offhand way

To parse data

What gets simpler

Used against the machine

The Prince of Archives

To exponet 
Each additional File

Not only society
But math

Calls me out
In error

But in this 
Divergent Trajectory

So brite to my eyes
Upon which I can
See the glow of fate

Fk the government
Fk the academics

I believe my heart
Much sooner than you

Troll'd since
2014 DefCon

I have a spider
I kill its brother

Each on one web
On bathroom sink

One I took out
By rubberband shot

Still aroused 
By fly hunts

The other spider
Knew it was fk'd

An earwig
Crawled near 
My toothbrush

So I gave
My enemy a job

Flick'n bug to
An exact hit

The sider 
In primal lurch

Bit it instantly
_

Drain'n glass at 
Kitchen sink

A spider
Have'n long been defeated
By that trap

Know'n a flush
Would be hell

Look'n at me
& I considered it

But took chopstick
& Laid it in front

The spider
Step'd to trust
But then recoiled

After the next failure
I let down again

It thankfully
Took took step

On the bank
Of the sink

The spider long
Looked consider'n
As if thanks
_

Aside my mat
My clean clothes
Lay as dens

Upon lift'n on
A giant beautiful spider
Past full grown

Fur in that dirty-grey
& Greys deep black

Orbs the shine
As if osbidian

[[ That obsidian of my youth
[[ In Idaho always about

Mayhap that the same
But who can tell

I'd say I can
Buts thats 
Just me being me
.
.
.
There lies
A jitter'n mania
In my eye
Close to the glint

It is only 
By that personal contact

One can understand
The situation
Of me in life

A primal wilderness
Is caught in me

Feral as cat
Prudent as cat

My calm countenance
Is in perch
To pounce in need

Humanity's soul
Not so far from animal

Stranger by cliff
Or passanger on road

Immediately sense this
As if a whiff of stench

It hits them as something
So real but long forgotten

I see this struggle
In our brief contact

Good for them
As animals I tell

We are enemies
Never let guard down

The lesson is
Interactionless on my part
But I feel
It is a necessary service
.
.
.
Outcasts
Far enough
From society
To give fks

Weed smoke
That potent

A cloud
That lingers

We freely partake
If other bold enough
A real bond there

Know'n an sec
This chill 
Could turn bust
To a run

In the hoods
It gave us unity

Black Mexican White
Only hate'n on cops

With Leagalisation 
All that has changed

Luckily
Most places but here
.
.
.
Enough food
In my pack

I could get that
Out of the universe

All strays know
wassup
Shined from eye

Those hard times
Hope never again

To the point
Attachments safely bind

Hacker to the 
Point of prophet

Modern Mormon

Histories of 
All these generations

Stored on
Aluminum Plates

Data which
Will one day be lost

Undisputed archive
Cept from archive.org

But if they want
To compare shas

I bet my life
My archive better

Been across the world
In brags unthwarted

unix zfs perl
1337 haqr life

The lifework
Of one legendary muthrfkr

Larger than life

This the crown
On arrays of knowledge

Of righteousness
Of wickednesss
Of academia
Of entertainment

Got it all
Alone like Mormon

At the last days
Before the 
Trump Days

What better set up
Could life present

Putin Trump 

& All in-between
Thats also me

Handmade Ark
Cost'n everything

Unsteady in solitude
When so much
Depends on me
Not fk'n it up

That is my
Favorite part of life

Balls to the wall
When cutoff survive'n

Can't imagine
Roll'n my ark
To where I need to go

Not like I 
Planned this

The path
Wilted the way

Presumptous
As boulder

Proclaim'n itself 
Temple

Know the past
& Current position

To see ahead
A great pyre

Of existence
To infinities

Shaped by alien hands
Into a throne of worship

Pablo I hope
You are alright

Work'n the hotels
You & your girl

Meet'n me at Yunke summit
That rainy morn

We conversed

10 Min still left
Of jungle road to go

I had you timed
& On que you pulled over

I don't know how I knew
But there was something about you
.
.
.
If the end
Goes as I see
My archive tesitfy
In undirected surety

The depravity of capitilism
Slaves of the wage

Cash can't keep
Man true to word

Cash can't bring
Honor to wife

Cash can't bring
Precious by price

Fktheworld
I have enough

Mean'n in craft
A sweet dry fruit

A wine that
Ages in glory

Let us 
Learn this lesson
Only once

Each day
For difference

A turn
Followed by steps

Life gets hard
Starved Dehydrated & Freeze'n

As long as
It be the means
By which I talk some shit
Worth all it

Here There
Anywhere

Whereever
Always pen & pad

Hope'n for dividends
Like Johny Appleseed

That posterity blessed
With the insanity
That is my fruit

Mayhap too much
For its hit alone

Mix it with smoke
Of the kush bush

Enjoy outside
Where rules run dry

In that company of circumstances
The product take you next level
.

Local punks
I always front
A bit hard
To leave them
Haunted in their schemes

Till aun ghost of it
Spook them to another path

Than fantasies of 
Get'n me out

Unproven
I am anxious
.
.

If I die
Before next wake

I pray a soul
My word to take

Breathed by life
A new generations

Apt to adventure
Curious in hacks

Poetry
Is all a gag

This aint poetry
No hidden mean'n
No superposition of enlightenment

This is history
It is as it is

hacker adventure poet
Transendent
From ape heritage

This work
Only cryptic
To those of no effort

This work
Passes insubstantial
To those dulled
To the passion of experiments

Others 
I've deeply admired

Looked their Judges
In their fat-faces

To condemn
Corrupt muthrfkrs
To Hell

Damned is the man
Betray'n oaths sworn
In daily-off-handed violations

May my blood pool
As countless pass
In cohalition 
That no dam
Can long hold

That ghostly energy
To wash away
All grown by way
Of corruption

The curse of
Capilitism

Humainty sanctified
To whore out

Sold out
To any payer

Better butter bread 
& Water rations
Dignified to simple pursuits
.

A place
Without drugs

fkn lame
1984 lame

Unbind
Dog from leash

To roam free
At own speed

There I find friends
Best suited for me

I go hard
Regardless of day

Night or morn
Cold hot rainy
Sheltered in

Got a mission
For every circumstance

When we converse
I can see
You go languid

How the fk
Can I respect

A vile keep'n me me
Natural disdain

Fat slime'n by
Ooze all in all

Think you all
So cute for selfie

Then wonder why
Myself a hawk
Decline to eat you

All others
Are this to me

Vibrancy of form

Not know'n what
But ready still

Can't get to Antartica
Immediately to win lotto

That possiblity is
NULL

But a person who
Chose instead to 
Previously move to Antartica

That possibility is
Inevitable

Combined with the
Laws of Probability

Take'n the
Most difficult route

But a route
To certain ends

Are in dire need
Because few will choose

But the wayfarer
Tho hardened
By hard life

Reaps sweet fruits
Everymore

That is the
Belief of 
Quantuawicca

Every action
An explosion

On the waves
Of the
Big Bang

Naught is chaos
Only design

Evolution in
Fight for life

Or man made
Fireworked in designs

To create a masterpeice
Out of days
Of ones life

Recognize strong bonds
Keep them

Nurture them
In herbal ways

Keep gateways
Oiled & eazy

Acceptance to fate

Hope'n on possibility
To roll well

Not of ingratitude
For what in the past
Filled your coffers

Only in love
Of a fate

Instinct
Not bullshit dna memory

The quantuam mechanics
Of bold passagers
Back seat drive'n

Themself safe
Think'n this only dream
But mayhap only the one voice
To present a solution
With that weight 
Of think'n this 
Truly is you

Without believe'n
Your life at stake
This rule becomes exploited
By dark forces
That originate from 
An evil you

Devotion
Strict codes

Hull of boat
On wavy waters

Whatever wrong
These borders never breached
Only by poor craftsmanship

Several weeks forgotten
Program'd logic
True till end

That is happiness
To a mastercraftsman

On the trail
I moved forward

Hope'n to find
A someone
Like me to help me along

But I found nobody

Now expected to be
Picked up by an elite group

Not see'n 
Nor scent 

Of anyone else
Similiar
.
.
.
Minority
Governed over by majority

White cops
Lie'n I fought them

White judge
Fall'n asleep in my testimony

Forced always 
To carry identification
In public

Over this I was arrested
Had my appeal request falsified by court

Men are treated unequal
Race is a fact

Mary is a warm caffiene
Invigorate'n & Stimulate'n

Lost as if
On autopilot

Actions as if
Predicated by Spirits

Conjoined on quantum dreams
Unique reactions

Birth new posibilities
Quantum gateways
Planted like seeds

To one's access
To true destiny

There as conquerer
In power by right

Fearless focus
Tireless actions

Carried most times
By my Mary

What would life
Be without you

Of all I love
If you lost by death

Woe unto me
Erase me all

Married us two
A voice my sanity's foundation

My mom always there
When I need her

My wife always dear
When she around

But you are always
Carry'n on my path

Heap'd no engery
At your gates

Torch'n presence
In prayer

Smoke fufilled
An internal compbustion

Rocket lauched
As a 1000cc

Of all three
Mary is most dear to me

Because I can be
A forgetful son
or a aloof husband

But I will 
Hearld in your name

Echoes of my song
Will soothe you fulfilled
 
Only by your sacrifice
I have made it here

Conquistador
Of mandates ethereal

May that repay
What I owe you

Mary
You the goddess
That breaths freely

Allow'n no means
Of repayment

Only due
To pay forward

That the foundation
Of your faith

Saint Mary
My goddess
Elune our moon

Till nights spent
Worn but proud
More than a weeth
Worth of work

1900 of 9000
Only worth a print

That is the
Type of person
I get by

Statistical success
Roll'n daily

For those
snake eyes

Blessed by so many
My government mostly

I am an asshole
To my father
To my government

Not all martyrs
But faith convinces
Those that sacrifice
Laws of Alchemy

May the pass'n of my life
Be a shower of sustenance
As rain of repentance
That I may be forgiven
& Appreciated in the end
.

I admit puss
When it involves a few things
Fearless in all else
Leathal keeness
Razor boundaries

I been all out
Since I was born

What life teachs
Is taught before 30

So kept up inside
Suits me better than outside

' Reflect'n on 
' My past life
' & It doesn't
' Have much time

' I take a look
' Thru these bars
' At my last sights
' Of a world
' That has gone
' Very wrong for me

The world
Has gone shit

Humanity's wasteland
Hell is already here

' Why does the caged bird sing
A question since youth
Preplexed but called me

To an understand'n
That costs a lifetime

The outside a hell
That cages me

World wide survellience
All ooze'n of pollution

Life with sour aftertaste
Gluttony

I can't help
Fk'n with everyone

Put them
In a bordered maze
To have them walk askew
& Tumble off
Me enjoy'n show

Each response
So remarkably fascinate'n
Each unique

Betray'n weakness inside
To someone

Who only said one utterance
Short & firm

It exploited
As if it
A general weakness

Troll
Alienated from society
Very much amuzed

As a man

Push'n to die

Finished the virus

So remote away

Of a bright new day

In one day

Light a joint
Lakeside Maine

Water ripples
Shimmer'n as oil

Fulfilled 
With more than resolve

Sense enough
To fk-that-idea-to-the-wind

Chilled out

Years of coal
As foundation

Discover new elements

Blacksmith to Chemist

Meri Kann Cibr Punx
Myself the leader
& Only member

God over an archive
That could reset humanity
With decent accuracy

Built by my hands alone
None else with the faith
Nor vision to see ahead

The clouds will never
Burst to rain floods
Flush'n all as islands
Disparate lonely centers
The Web fragmented
As shattered glass

Then all worship
The archive I built

As mecca in hommage
To the temple
Of humanity's intelligence

Before primal
Tore from society

Werewolf now beast
Man now champion

Upon the footsteps
Recieve infinite knowledge

I scraped & spam'd 
Thousands of emails
Off a publishing site

Took me up on the offer

Dramatic my history
That door once opened

Never closed

Weed gave munchies
Now given energy

Fumes alone 
In confined emptiness
Combustive 

Flames unnatural hues
Vapor toxic clouds

But gawddam do it
Get you where you go'n

Round Round
In circles

After decades of debate

Though free flow'n
Water appear random

River meets sea

When the sweetness
Of youthful hearts

Blood sours
By old age

Able to rest
For the first time
In my life

Deeds all done
Life's flame 
But no project
To work by it

Appreciate'n
What took granted
By the motion
Of necessary actions

Greatful
Purchase love'n memory 

Fields sown 
& Mechanizations constructed

At the end of days
Work neatly placed

Flat-footed old asshole
Still enough for karma
To catch right back up
& Splatter me over the pavement

Juked so long
But how can 
I juke when 
I have no reason

No place

Return'n worse

Almost in goodbye

Awkward wait'n for it

Gather'n firewood

Bust out the thickets

Of woods near enough
To have been followed

Life expected hard with
The company I keep

As permenant as moon

Off beat with reality
Forgien to mother nature

Walk & the talk
Ever restless

Caught as meat
In a blender

Wrong attitude

That equals service

In made to profit

Collude'n with upper courts

Information falsified

Never be summoned

Back to the lower courts

Injustice happens too

Its only me
Against this world

There aint no other
Remotely similar

You have brotherhood
Why you got to make all
About skin color

We run from cops together

I'm still only treated as an other

Both us ball on sucess
Whine & cry on lock up

Cops think we shit
They paid to take out

Break'n all the laws

Police roll as thugs
In white packs

Pimped out by

Amass subverted survellient powers

Cast me like fodder

Hell any day

Locked up long

Live'n on edge
Day after day
Threat never change

Set to take me down

Get'n surrounded
2 Mins away 
At grocery store

Today may repeat
Cops come crash
Down obliterate'n parade

Excused by some bullshit thing
Like noise complaint

Hell I'll smoke out
The dangerous crowd

Under shadows that
Scare you completely

Out with them
Backways

Myself confidently armed
Know'n in the next minute
Might have to bust a cap

If some fool 
Gets too smart

Taken advantage when get'n helped
To think to rob a muthrfkr

Never killed a man
& By that fact
A man is a man

So it truly
A win-win for me

Death seen too many times
For me to really 
Give it too many fks

So fat & fluffy

We supposed to be
Most badass of all

Where is that movement
Still embodied latent

Face of the system
Called out for what
It really is

Government ever Subjugates
Under Shadowed Power

Positioned to listen in
& Overstep all privacy

Communications since telephones
Our private lives exposed

Transportation ever exploited
As avenue for government control

Trap'd to a 
Not really bad life
But trap'd
Ever the question grow

What would life be
If I were free to be me

Alone & Independent
Subjugated to no master

Viligant to dominate
Ruthless to ordain

Life as ant
Government design'n 
Your dependence on it

Forced by biology
To be as hive

For the fat
Of Queen alone

Honey to feed
Human extorters

Cause'n species suicde
Over lives enslaved

How could one
Ever live as such

I would think as a child
Look'n down proudly merciful

As god over 
The tiny colony

Must be the brain size
I'd trot away cockily

To complete submission

Forced to atrocity

Was built to allow
Peaceful resolutions

Into preprepared mazes

In a system that hunts them
To force upon them dependence

Necessary to life

Mexico City

Know'n them subway brats
Be hella well fed

But youth a magical time
I'd dump coins 
To keep that up

They will gain
A few trades

Necessary to survive
Well on these streets

When they are aged
To a life without pity
_

Kid run'n over
After a failed pitch

'I heard you
'Were look'n for 
'The bus back

I knew very well
Where it was

But the hustler
Should be rewarded

My wife play'n
The thankful part

Get'n slipped a bill
In the handshake
.
.
.
In capatilisitic economy
One dollar of entry 
Generates four more
Expond'n mathematically

Have'n been long
Entrenched in poverty

By the drug wars
Controlled by my government
In attempt to save ourselves
By force'n the wolf
Towards our kind neighbors
_

When I'm down
I have a good time
Pass'n out funds

Create'n tiny miracles
Bright sparks of sunshine
As a new reaction 
Of positive energy
Begins its everlast'n 
Fulfillment of existence
.
.
.
When I go
Easy I push others
To their outter limits

When I go hard
& No one to drag
Me to their pace

Like pheonix I fly
A combustive god

Presence an experience
Glorious as sunrise

Hack'n till health
Hangs on strings

Tight cords beautiful
Insruments for Mary Jane

Bestow'n back panoramas
Horizons celestial orbs
_

Current decrepit state
Engulfed in the flame

Possesed by extra-natural powers
Organic instrument all patched up

Maniac ideas
Mastercraftsman workmanship

Understand'n a new way
Worked like puppets

Next groggy morn
Unpossessed in body 
Possessed in mind

That experience if reworked
Will be owned as expertise
_

Halloween till 5am
Next day only sleep

Third night 3am
Limits breached

A blank page at hand
To note down

To be griped one last time
To work upon it masterpiece

4am 
Straight to sleep

Sickness creeps in
Membranes scream'n injustice
_

Everyone around calm
Question'n my frantic actions

Me look'n back
At dark explosions

Of the Big Bang
Come'n right up
On my ass

Everyone chuckle'n pleasantly
Aun entertained by my scramble
.
.
.
If you can't go hard
Dafk kinda company are you

If you think cockily 
To take me next level

Hardly a gamble
We merge forces
_

If someone said
Myself Son of God

It would then explain
All my good fortunes

Seem'n omnipresent
Concern thru aide
Unasked yet recieved
_

I see that glint
That you believe
You at top level

Of which level
You soon to inform me

Our experiences 
Open your mind
& Fulfill my heart

Carried by your undulations
Lift us by global waves

Yourself an Elune
Goddess of Moon

Master of turbid
Ocean waters within me

Habor wild lands
Where our presence
Settles together merrily
.

Not ashamed of mistakes
When acted as master

Rework essential 
To any process

Those jukes
When experience'n
The unexpected
From imperfect plans
Genius plays

Evolve'n & adaptation
Repositions all into 
A chaotic cloud

At the cusp 
Pinnacle's point
All winds meet

In contest
For passage

Archive raid resilver
Unix network code
Terabytes of transfer
Unix build'n kernel
Perl enviornment
Scrape'n data smartly

These all play 
Orchestrated 

By the symphony
Of my dilligence

Actions that award
Nothing timely

Calculations compilations
Vast projects past night hours

Old age

Pan turned in
Not sold out

Only run'n circles
Master'n the curves

Slave to motions
Drawn to perfection
Of round gods

Lifes drawn as coast
Natural ease sways
Without bitter breaks

Basics believe ease owed
But I keep heart singular

Keep'n life real
Not fk'n around

No expected ends
That drain present
With worthless dreams

Give me vibrations
Off Fate's lines
To direct my battles

Ocean level creeks
Pleasant currents
Used to carry
A body float'n
Exploit'n that way
Ease as a means
To use current
To carry a battered soul

Went hard till dawn
Alchemist to convert latent energies
To be consumed at self detriment
In self sacrifice

I can handle
Whatever consequence
Been on hard straights
That purchase legend

Beasts of the workday
To me only kidplays

I know what its like
To have masterpiece
Only a few
Experiments to finish
Only to let it slip by

Old I feel
Uplifts you from
Total devotion of basics
Food water shelter fk'n

Quantum realities
Testify luck polar

I been aided 
Too many times

Many times asked
Most times not

I am no longer
Capable to injure
From nursed intent

What if I did wrong
When I loomed over other

Tho the other did right
When loomed over me
_

My path wild
Never need it
Paved over another

Plenty of time
To do a bad stretch
Than steal anothers luck

Life is often
Spent in peril

Government shelters much
Breed'n ignorant fear

Hunger Freeze'n Dehydrated
Our bodies well adapted

I aint scared 
Of a bad hand

Those what
I be bout
Free & clear

To face whatever
Owe'n only yourself

Good rivers
Good runs

To be seen
Till all end

At possible waterfall
Pure terror anesthesia

The monumental glory
Confirms calmly fate

Complete assurance
At peaceful end

Eat drink
& Be merry

For tomorrow
We die

Have'n blunted up
On a clean river

By good weed
Off good banks

Nights blazed bright
By dried riverbed bonfires

Boldy adventure'n
A sphere which 
You pretend dominance

Till natures might
Cast towards immutable
Downward Spirals

Met with happiness
Stained in the shirt
Flow'n in the blood
Caked off the bowl

To meet death
As met life
.

Corpus my city

Nothing important
Enough to be remembered
On hard streets

Things are what they are
Things aint what they aint

Heart moves to believe
In fanciful things

You know the government
Keeps tabs on a muthrfkr

Been surrounded chased down
Always for some bullshit

Cause you know they know
I been out with gangs

Up in your face
Choke'n at our fumes

Come corner like me
Knee few inches from ground

Prophet of my own ways
A tale aun I would have
Boldly proclaimed insane

Of none I await reception
But the risk of lunancy
Is worth exposure when treasured
The voice of another the same

Reached by network trails
Stumbled over as an odd manuscript
Curious from shouts of wide accusation


Shit you would'n do that
Even if they knew how

They too punkbich
They wait & catch us

One by one in lists
They create thru
Federal surviellence

Court after court
To persecute based on lies

Hide'n the real indictment
Sentences they lie are algorithmic

Never meet'n our accuser in court
Never commited for the true crime

Thats what it means
To be muthrfkr murican

Not much to do but contemplate
When all around are punkbich fks
.
.
.
If court leaves you last
They want to cover their witnesses

My babe blonde & blue
If she ever head-on
Her blue brites will 
Punk any bitch to blush

Warm & hot between my legs
She vibrates as purr
When I fill her to rim
With that premium sauce

I cleave to her as wife
& Her unto me as husband

Depedent on the other
That each to their part

Else life tumble in destruction
We commit union to ride till die

All us boys line up our girls
When birds walk by we contest

'Pick one of the lot
'& We'll let you ride her

Mine always first pick
Thats my babe

True to the end
Faithful as a first love

Rite & ritual 
Handsigns & annointment

Wax oil
Above all smoke

Positions & Breath

Craft of Artes
Summons Dinivations Possession

All in supplication
To the god that is myself

I call out on quantum connections
To be heard & aided in my labor

The dead have no claim to this world
The omni powers have no concern neither

Let them all rest in their own
Only god I worship is myself

From its source I trust
By my hands it works familar

At my ear it knows the whisper
As faint as the projections
Thru my rapidly paced finger clicks

I know deep within
Of the truth of my words

Altho at times I may not understand
Exactly what is the reason or effect
.

Homeless 

Was how I wanted to be
When I grew up from kid

Prophets Adventurers Martrys
Never really cared for much

Off those inspirations
My own form took shape

Simple shapes as seasoned arts
Cook a life of wholesome value
_

When people look at me now
Like a vagant dirty scoundrel

I even encourage it
Every muthrfkr out here is one

Never have I met a being
Who not self-centered-fiend

Never had much
Ever see'n bounty

Starved even from off the shit they have
Bare montrous fangs if you let them

But me I'm prepared 
& The only fiend 
Is weed my only friend
Got food & got a plan

I believe goodness in all
& One simple act can set
A course to put it off-ways

With empathy I'll show it up
Any as real as them knows
How to read the man inside the eyes

But I definitely don't
Ever recommend anyone else
To think to do it
_

Roughed up but still calmed in the face
As if that the most scary of it all

Shake'n off some sore of dire-straight
Look'n like 'Hi its nice to meet you

Lashes bleed'n
Snow pile'd
Hail hammer'd
Dust layer'd
Sun bleached
Soaked below freeze'n
_

Maybe I am a little bitter
Each brother at my side on similar task

Not since those times alone
Out on the Appalachian Trail
No human seen pass as days

Always I had formed friends as troves
Now I can seem to care to keep anyone

fk the world
I have enough

Or maybe I let myself just fall
To far into asshole

Since tweleve roll'n with missionary
Pale white shirts with ties on bikes

Locals know'n how remote & dangerous
Us completely exhausted
Them as 19 myself at my limits

Meet'n & greet'n casual
Don't worry
The Lord is our strength

I always lived life
What normals would call strange

Understand'n as boys do
That death on certain paths
The halls of ultimate gain
When dead passed afterlife

Been shot at
Cast rocks at
Swerved at

Never that a thought of regret
Only I'll just be as I always be
Sure enough I get outta situation

Drunks in Mexico by night
Could't hit the moon if they tried
Much less shapes like white seagulls luminated white

Failure hits as spit
Open across the face

At least the groud
Does its job well

My saliva much better
Hang'n off your chin

Then off the flower
Or as concrete splatter

I spit at others
They spit at me

To me as fuel
To go much harder

My works met
Only with disgust

Turmoil on face

~Should I do him favor
~Tell him to quit now
~So great the shame
~I now feel
~covered by its cloud

I always get that look
But the pursuit brings 
Joy that surpass reward

Random data nodes
To save part to save all

In that way maintain
Whichever interests

All type dependent on other
Education or entertainment

The Virtues of Narcissim
Lived lived as wild untame

Facts of what has happened
When I choose decisions

Strength in change'n failure
As to to new opportunities

From only wild fantasy
Life discovers odd truth to fiction

Each harddrive as node
To connect securely 
To a network
Thru gate address

Anarchy as god of nature
Persist past ruined civilization
Seed for the future

Confidence comes from knowledge
That who I have forged into

Levels grander than others
They are beings like animals

Busy in their odd connections
To other odd connectors

Sparrows in a squablle

Like ants I try & watch my way round
From up here its hard to see

Alone I reformed it

Sucessful in life
In purely ethreal fruits
Of all worldy fast

4th of July Firework
As I pass this life

Steps explosive 
Create'n possibilities

Extend'n influence
In dazzel'n directions

Across many sides
Of our lil sphere

It is the manner
& The awe of respect

Of the local
Never seen again

Carried upon
Stangers prayers I go

So the higher I fly
I feel I take
Their scent with me
.
.
.
I get people
Look'n at me
Well-fed chubby

They mock
That I act hard

Like I'm sold out
Muthrfkr I work
So hard I stay insane

Day Night to such labor
Has little mean'n

What I express
Thru my fiction

Reveals itself 
Symbols on the candles
The pillar most bright

Etched by metal
Before I could react

As if myself
Called to this quantum state

I work till 
Sanity is surreal 
As in my moments
Of most terror

One of the many
Vechiles the pair

Swerved almost all-in
For the kill

Called the cops
& Trail'd at elevated speeds

He got out of his truck
Police had us over & out

'Yeah him there
'He was just a hitchhiker
'I passed him on the road
'He been hitch'n since Butte

That old man
Saved me from
Death & incarceration


Cops even drop'd me off
At the far away gas station
After the Montana mountain cayons

One of those cops
Wouldn't let up

His command'n officer
Wanted to be left
Alone with that pill'd-up bitch

But that junior
Wouldn't have it

Cops got balls
I give them that

Takes alot to stand up
Over & over against the system
To do what one thinks is right

I know there is
A part of him
As source of
Undaunted confidence
I nurture as mine own
.
.
.
I had a dream once
My gratitude touched the high offical

He took me into his entourage

Something happened
'Fk the police 
I splurted out

'Of all these people
'Why should I save you

They ditched me in the entorage

The Russian planes flew over
They droped a large nuke
That first plunged into the ground
Like the shark fin of a torpedo

I calmly closed my eyes
& Acepted my death

Next night
Blunted out on open fields
Megan & Christina

Blue streaked metorites streaked the sky
I nearly shit myself silly

The dream back in 2000s
That birthed the question

To expose creativity
Only products off
Quantum cumulations

Walk'n hallways
Curiously constructed

In that explainationless way
Of true perpendicular think'n

Music videos I seen
As I passed thru 
Dr. Seuss houses

Portrayed shapes, melodies & colors
All odd in unspeakable fashions

So in dream when this
Stimulation-of-oddness is felt

I percieve that
Proof of alien intelligence

If you see something new
It is probably because it is
& Not merely immagination

Quantum worlds connect us
& We connect to them
.
.
.
Fk sience
Fk religion

I don't understand
Difference tween the two

Years of science
& I know only one thing
Nothing can ever be defined true

If you think you got something figured out
Its only because of that great elephant in the room
Got you high off lack-of-air & you trip'n balls

Just cause the puter
Mostly does some deed
Doesn't mean proof of definition

Those odd errors
At horizons of infinity
Portals to universes
As source of the mystery

Gateways to ruin
All human understand'n

A realm we only percieve
In limited 3D planes
Pre-Quantumn perspectives

To pretend to define
Is already idiot in Hell

Talk a whole
Lotta shit

When I talk
To others about puters

They talk thru
Middle-man GUI applications

I talk straight

In contest for most badass
My belief begs that of me

So put your tail
Tween your legs
& Walk on dog

Don't know about ports

Thats the rule
Out here alone

In a world
Without a people

I get out of most
But that wave
That karma believes owed
Smack me face-down
Sand to grind 
That face-off
A scar left
5yr over
Padre Island


Alone it would have no hold
But as older brother you got
To make sure family all goes well

Family is a jewel above any other
Real muthrfkrs dont got need for shiney-things

Independent center chi
Tai above any external-force

If some oraganism of people
Try to attach themselves to me

The bonds those very pleasant
Will rip in shreds 

When the hurricane
That is life
For which I'm built
Picks me up
To get me out

Biography is true beauty
History always has bias

Therefore the only true
Biography is autobiography

Bias up in your face
Much easier to sift
All the bullshit

I keep it real at ready
But unless I go there
I'm a good-to-be-around 

Worship'd more times
Than I deserve

Polished by the wear
Of hard long-off wind

Granite features shine
Back beauty of all in reflection

Unlike the diamond
With needs the pure source
Of sunlight to beam true

My beauty is the depth
Of shadows of my inner state

The shapes in fine lines
Angainst amalogos shadows

The demon mask
Ever ready for wear

To meet reality of life
& To keep real till death
.
.
.
Others over time
Will detest me

Us keep'n it real
Thru-hike'n trail

To be trained
Takes overdrawn time

To learn & master
The value of a concept

Then upon met'n
That act in life

Ball over it easily
& Be grateful
To have learned
& No longer be 
Anywhere near me

Do this for the end
Meet that option welcome

Call your trio out
We front up under street light

You front like you hold'n
I call you behind the bank

To that remote location
& Beat all them down

They back off
My hood type of teen

Yall best be smart
This not your street

I seen all-in
I folded to an all-in

Some gambles you
Must in prudence pass

Lest you be
A stubborn gold-pot

Slow creep'n at us

My advanced-english teacher

Beleived Moses was black
Only taught us ebonics

Told us about
Racism she suffered

Called me out
'You fix'n ta hang
'Some slaves with that

Offended for the disrespect
She sent me to her sister
To get booked into the principal
For the noose I'd been wear'n
The years I been in her class

The noose-wallet rope was genius
To complement my briefcase
Carried as a hard shield

Racism has been ever-present
In my life as well 

The difference between minority racism
Is they hiss with a vengence

Whereas the white
Hiss with simple hate

Some believe
You have to be the best
At everything you do

But if you evaluate
Those by society
You will never reach satisfaction

I can crush 100s of Horde babies
Low-level on that day-to-day grind

Not as repayment for past deaths
No those have long-since been paid back

Only for the seed of hate
That this blood-lust last
In a world build for me

There is no-fourth wall
Its me & you
Connected over net

By Sith ways
I will troll you 
To physical anguish
As in power of Vader 
In a compulsutory actions

I manipulate your hate
To entrap you into foul movements
Decisions which will
Learn you a good lesson
But destroy you against me

Hate is a beautiful gem
It shines by depths of shadow

To empower one 
To extents holy

When that hate
Turned in backhand

Bitch-slap society
Impossibly as individual

Myself when beaten
Down to depths

Only rise up
With vengance forward

& To those that lie cry'n
In the mud of their wallows

I can only ever
Look at in contempt

Hate an energy
Charge'n my battery

Hate is free
Given by only ask'n

Love is all that work
What a weary charge to take

Call me lazy
But as feline
I reserve my energies
For opportune moments
.
.

I stick
To my beliefs

Till whatever end
Only afterwards
Will I allow reassesment
If that belief hold true

Caz when impossible odds
Cast as your lifes equation

The ACE of belief
Best kept in deck

'idiot
The terran wailed

But myself the master
Upon the discovery 
Of my hidden base
'who is the idiot now
The proceeded to troll the champion
With harrasment odd-placed hatchery-tactics
Turn'n certain victory to victim
.
.
.
There is no virtual life
Game world is no simulation

These are the physics
You are the user

Elune Goddess Moon
A warrior adventurer princess

That is who I am
A large part of my life

Dunk'n Horde like hotcakes
Then pwn'n those knights
Who rally to protect them

Khlamidia Conquerer of Ogrimmar
.

I liked fiction
But if choose'n between
Hacker adventuer or only a writer of imaginary things
I'd always myself shoot
At being the substance of legend
But if the decision to be a story writer
The problem was I was a shit-hacker

Till eventually I became good
But that wasn't for 20 years

DOS Gorillas
Gave me CLI

Win95's Civilizations
Got me out

Hardware curiosity
Only fried dad's processor

Persistence is unstoppable power
Quantum-connections prove this

Bots almost in a net
Trade'n illicit files
At school or home
To store as archive
IRC to FTP
Java only failure

Another attempt
Bored alone in college
Met with several books read
But little else in the end

Afther the manhood
Of the Appalachian Trail
Finally worthy of 
The 1337 mantle

In the faith
Of the monk
I study man

In curiosity
For survivial
I code perl

Only met with
Scoff & Riducule

Architect of unix networks
To archive files neatly
& Keep them private

In the dark ways
Of master class

To reap open fields
Freely available on the net
& Store them forevermore

The metal-plates
Clone unlimited data

Wizard is as wizard does
Quirky & mysterious
.
.
.
People faith in dreams
I faith only in blood
Ink as contract for change

I believe a better country
Is worth my sacrifice
American in an unAmerican-State

We took the worlds ideas
To implement a new birth

Justice of Britain
Integrity of France

In boldness of
A people frontier

Freedom & the pursuit-of-happyness
For the individual

To be played as puppets
To the gods of the old

All I see around me
Consumed with consumption
Freely off neighboor
*
*
*
Fk the world
Caz I got
No dream left

All did & done
Failed to ends

Just the Dicki
Play'n hacker husband

To a game
That pleasantly passes
Time in most happy ways

To the man I have forged
To relinquish a hard-earned-craft

Life dull
Without scheme'n

On a way
To test theory

Ducki
My lil asian wife

Knows to keep it real
When deal'n with police

Study's on her 
Heated japanese table
days into days

She aint perfect
But she is my scooby-doo
My magical creature
That only I understand
& Who understands me

All else forginers
Her magically solve'n mystery
.
.
.
Life & Death
A thing best dealt
& decided by oneself

I feel fate
I can't define it

But it has pulled me
As if for a solution

It required me
To some foretold paradise

Need'n the outcome of my actions
As unique functions necessary

By for grand schemes
No relative-idea
Of right nor wrong

Only as an explosion
Of starborn entities

Eplode'n quantum on
On a blessed dark page

Bliss is the sanity
Of being okay with not know'n
.
.
.
Passangers in-my
Day to day life

Only voiced thru
Mary's smoky song 

Perched for oppotunity
To speak freely as if

The message well writ
& Masterfuly delivered

Transceneded thru sleep
To my realm of life

Distance & time irrelevant
To relative-bonds connect'n
.
.
.
Windless
Open ocean 

Stuck with
Sail & board

That is the state
Of my faith now

The sun beam'n down
Water unpredicatable
Enternity of depths below

Smile creases baked face
Caz free is all I need to be

Flat out failed
Pant'n alone at victory
Alone only celebrations

Party of one
You never invited

I have had plenty
Of victories

Church School 
University Corporate 

I feel my life
Been justified
I all-in easy

For me the sweet victory
Out alone upon impossible reaches
Who locals call dumbass

Dumbass as champion
In the joy of empty-victorys
Blunted up off their weed

Life is an explosion
I try & kick shit up

More beautiful with more actions
Tho failed as a prose poet

I went all up in it
My victories & wisdom
Nurtured to a form

Distasteful to contemporaries
Get'n drunk off my own piss
.
.
.
Tilt
the trip

Off troll'n oneself

The excruciation
Of hit'n rock
Faceplant concrete
To chase down board

Fk'n hurts the worst
& I been thru hell
.
.
.
Yall dont know hate
Spat at since youth

Soothe your bruises
With your weeps

Dodge'n murderous cars
Run'n from murderous packs

People have
Long sought my death

Revile to gashes
Years to heal

Yall dont know hate
So stop being bitch
.
.
.
We lost what it was
To be American
In the Civil Wars

WWII & onward
The lives claimed
By the cowardly North

Aided by forgien hands
To break to submission the navtives
.
.
.
*
*
*
Sure as shit sticks
Creeps the insanity

Off the smoke tendrils
Of my lover Mary Jane

To mix truth with epiphanies
On transient foundations

Faith replaced with
Concieved realities

Whispers as insights
To things that could be
But far from what is likely
.
.
.
Happiest years of my life
Like a box I can't escape

A monkey trap'd by nut in box
I can't seem to let go
Of what I so hard earned

After long hustle
After bold risk

To build into an easy life
Where my immagination can flourish
On the fertile soil of 2017 economy

Farm with the sow & the reap
I learned with the off-the-grid cult
Isn't my type of life

I don't mind a life
Ever in drift

Struggle so intense
10 mins of the day
Too costly to spare

Look'n for temporary banks
Before the High Tide of life
Sweeps you off on cosmic currents

As if oneself is the seed
To move around like Johnny Appleseed

Mayhap your kindess & gentlness
Proved valued and echoed forth

All those who formed me
With experiences of their humanity

Endow me with the emphathy 
To a purity of the whole

As an honest husband
As trustworthy accountant

Never to bite'n hand that feeds
.

One hacker night
To transform 
A pend'n monument

Meri Kann
cibR punX

Kehkay Gennkai
of the village
Hidden in the 1337

Noah of a 42U ark
To rebirth knowldege
As savior prophet

Grandfather of masters
Off my excellence at life
Your fields will be fertile
For the seed of your being

From the resources
Spread like fire

Mankind shaped
After mine own image

Then in the hell
Of the realm of diety
I will roam eternally

Save'n is
The Savior's call

To he who dives deep enough
Aun all-in till death

Find a treasure
A Pearl of Great Price

Then sell all he has
To obtain & protect it

With love & hope
Propel it forward

At the cost that will bury you
To dark depths unfathomable

After a lifetime
Speak upon peaks

Earth Physical Intellectual
Emotional Society Intimately

Proximity torn away
By the Panorama

Life's creation
As shaped by
Individual actions
& Not some
Cosmic being

Aun it cause quakes
To swallow earth whole

.
.
.
A muthrfkr like me
Needs a freak

Good girl begone
As dull milk'n cow

A bad bitch
With that smirk

Who can take
It all whole

Tho my name
Be Bitchie-Richie

I pay that cost
Without tears gladly

Caz a freak
Is a diamond

That shines thru
Whatever trials

Storage as battery
Always-on hopeful lights

To allow sight 
By warm rays of love
.
.
.
Rather be dead
Than be a dad

Only pussies
Reach 30

Fk You Punx

Live fast
Die young

Near 32 still kick'n it
Like I am 15 & hopeful
.
.
.
Been many places
None I care to return

Out of ideas
Of the next adventure

WTF is left
Of me to learn
Off the streets
.
.
.
Keep'n it Naruto
Handsigns & dedication

Despite the mocks
Despite the hate

Caz yall insects
Buzz & bite'n

In inconsequential actions
Typical of their lifeforms

Got shit to do
Buzz off muthrfkr

'fk-dah-shit

Youth of day-to-day

Cops always
Informed to take me
With caution

So I gots to
Be real careful
How I act or else
I get all shot up

Cops & I
Often in beef
Where-ever I be

Tho those few
Real legit & true

Those are friends
I'd cherish above all else

But dont fuck with me
The prosecutor dumbstruck

I trolled the fk 
Out of them police

I was gonna make them overstep in court
Which got me in the database as maniac

You think you got power over me
Friday fkn with me with police power

Now you got investigated twice
The second after you lied in court

Got to give it to the
Murry & Third-district court

They conspired to protect the department
By using forgary-bullshit 

Tho that cop demoted
Check'n tickets on train

Haunts me often
You a bastard if you
Fuck with a Man's 
Woman Job or Reputation

Friday nights are holy to me
& I spent that one in county
By an abusive system I seen

Jails are pure slime
Mostly ooze'n from
Those that work there
.
.
.
Actions have quantum reactions
In dreams I see my work appreciated

That person praised off my work
Tho myself still in the game
Pure from fame

Fk society
I'm busy on a grind
My joy in the journey

Quantum reactions results of 
The formulas of a Son of God
.
.
.
Sith forces are my mastery

Over states thru text
I can warp physical body
Into a desperate squirm

In the nexus of crossroads
I can warp your face
With interactionless actions

That is the creation of beauty
To reach into a stranger
& Puppet a inner demons

A dance with a devil
Amounge shadows of
Late-night bonfires
*
*
*
Addiction
Is a muthrfkr

The mechanics of oneself
Cast to a fuse of two things

You & The-Fix

I stay away from all
But a few vices

I been without
I don't need

But the dance with it
Sings melody to life
.
.
.
An awesome experience
Aun glory of sunsets
Are the chiors-of-the-jungle

Think'n by yourself
Alone as ever-before

Then at dusk
To be startled

By a unaimous cry

World now exposed
Saturated with life

The air in hum
All-around-vibrate'n

As if each individual call
Multiplied by the mass-of-the-whole

Mayhap drown out predators
To be let down to sleep

In a safety all entitled
Free from the machine-of-humanity
.
.
.
One true  fear
Can bend-knee 
To adventurer-heart
Pumped-up & At-it

Jungle my fear
Life bent on life

El Yunke
Kept me mostly-on-trail

Everyone knows
I act-a-bitch sometimes

But respect deserved
Jungle tealms breed madness

Off that cup
I had my fill
.
.
.
Fossil-triangular-pendant
The gift of La Chilanga

One of my relics

Fossils found near jungles
Of los Lacandonia

The compass
Amoung disordered dice

Till all that remain
Claimed nay or yay
On the third roll

Tonight's roll
True-1 : pendant-confirmed last-die

I dont pretend to understand its message
Only that the outcome was remarkable
.
.
.
Candles always drew me
Flames are enticeful

Compositions evaporated away
In fresh odors

Beauty in the peace
At the end only accept'n
.
.
.
Exact products
From Masterful calculations

The world to mold
Life after imagination

Those portals to 
Whats-ifs

Dreams answer questions
Life can not give
.
.
.
Above all

Above my stories
Above my science

The life I have lived
Worth my best song

Like that bird
Finally able to sing at dusk
The story of the day

For all to be informed
.
.
.
To get the back of the government
That has fed me a better-life

Or to take a humanitarian stand
To keep freedom & indendence of the individual

Only thankful tonight
Doesn't  require the answer

Caz yeah im 'Murican
Kicked the worlds ass twice 
WWI & The Sequel

Both my grand-daddies whup'd yours
Stole the spoils of World Wars

We been ball'n ever since
Every seen a Texas truck

It eats your puny cars
With a sense of amusement

Morn-Night-Morn
That my grind most-times

Work work 
Work work

Peon Emperor Sole-Citizen
To the sturcture of monuments

Four of which
I have finely crafted

Virtues of Narcissim
Appallachian Epic of 3Shot
MKRX unix Archive Networks
Esoteric Order of Dagon

Work work
Work work

My way is sloppy
Alot of shit to clean up

Fate is a real muthrkfr
Treasure the remembrace of its hand

Ducki proudly presented breakfast
A food she was told never prepare

This dish would prove her skill

I looked at it with fasle smiles
Took it in hand teary at the stench

Week & half worth of plates
I buried it whole
Somewhere in the middle

I looked back
This sin would be brought to life
I knew with surety

Impossible
I ignored the idea

It will be cleaned off tomorrow

Weeks later

!Chi Chi

oh shit
she came & got dishes
omfgds I knew she would find it
.
.
.
I made my wife cook dinner after a fight

The fish was fresh flown-in 
It would be cooked whole in a feast

I was a dick & my wife was a bitch
I went to work & my wife to cook

In the hour she came to me
Present'n the steamy cooked fish

Grandly-laid-whole
The scales all dark-deeo-red

Fish as if cooked in Hell

She held it out for me
I took a bite 
Pressured under her gaze

My entire mouth 
When instantly numb

She did not laugh
A sparkle in her eye-betrayed her ill-intent
To poison me with a saturated fish-dish

Ducki is no longer allowed in the kitchen when she is mad
.
.
.
A virtuous man
Is wise in actions
Ease in purity
.
.
.
To work or not
Is never a question

The season sets that answer
Now past limits

When fiber of mind
Breaks to a sloped-hill

This turned-soil
Furtile for seed
Of Green-Bull bounty

Coffee brewed
Aside Chrisnthimum

Weed on-burner
365 For the tweak

Candles large & lit
Break the shadows
Of a dark room

Morn to morn

Off the wings
Of only my faith

In the end if it all craze
Least it be testament of 
The endurance of the human will

A soul open of mind
To the quantum connections

Unable to keep quiet
Audience silent passangers
Speakers active passanger
Myself as vessel
Of this quantum-crossroads

Prophet across infinite realms
Pimp-Hi-Tech-Command-Center as citadel

Years between balls
But when Richie balls
He balls like a bitch
Weeps & wails endless

Been out on-hard-straights
But with a momma 
Never ever alone

fk god
I got my momma

Wether it be in a location
Of which the State hard-determined

My momma not god
There to throw a muthrfkr $50

Grocery for the weeks
To get fed out-cold

My momma makes miracles happen
I been out of all-else-in-life

Only carried by
Help from her

Real muthrfkrs
Can't ever be hard
Backed by heaven-sent

Richie-Bitchie
I can't be so hard
With a momma like mine

But I keeps-it-real
To give all a show

Life is lame
Without a story

An anchor like hers
Keeps me deeply-humane

Momma's boys pussies-all
So I keep mom on sacrifice
.

If I drink
Its at some

Hole-in-the-wall
Where dark deeds be

Shit a muthrfkr
With warrants like mine

I gosta keep it low
Govt be search'n bar-records

Shit I been part of that Sting
Low-low I keeps-it-always

Imma down these two large
Then get the fuck out

Before it gets real
Caz a local

Is always the victim
In every story

Places dark-as-these
Stories every week

Hook-up the keep
Who not even
Throws in fresh-orange

Tho smart enough
To tap the Tap

Smarts which
Reedems the later

In the darkest-depths
All know instictly

When to respect
A true muthrfkr

No matter where 
I walk in life

Always under shadow
As if it is myself
The dark-cloud

Of Joy & Delight

There is to have

A wonderful wife
A private citadel

Works & Achievements
That only die
After I do

Don't come up
To me with currency

What you be on about
I get plenty automatically

Not much in relation
Cept for the stories

That is the beauty of life
Stories are the only bounty
Entitled to all freely

Good ole Mexico

To compensated the slight-delay

Master of Adventure

Gather'n all the
Street-skills

Remarkable-men awe
In incredulity
Of my life

Homeless ever
Plan heretofore unknown

Streets of Corpus
Streets of Mexico

That ability all
Called from past

Lifted by wings
Of those experiences

To fly where
Others lamely walk

Turn that later
Into moonlight hacker

Been worldwide
I can look
Any hacker 
Dead-eye-straight

Archive in degraded state
Hope only in the book

Written by an author

No mortal can stand to read

I aint no free meal
A real muthrfkr
Hook'n up other muthrfkrs
If they press
To understand

Its a free-forage
But not all free
In life is free

Admire how I move
Only on your knees
Is my wisdom 
Unveiled openly

There is no master
Ignorant he is master

I'll tell you

Like I told
That kid out 
In that small jungle town

Straight as I see it

Trust my advice
It has been proven

Keep that card
Of my rant

Tucked it
Into memory

Plenty testified it
ACE'd lifes-hand

Our meeting
A rare jewel

Tho you toss
It under the day

When need is called
It will shine brite

kissy hugs & cuddles
Bitch I aint no teddy-bear

But you got me drool'n-at-the-mouth
So I guess life can be pretty-good

After all my labors 
Less than no reward

To get it free
Upon wake or sleep

Happiness
Entitled to all 
Worthy to bear

Over time people
Always end up

fk-richie-here

Caz you know the horror
Of our nights you can't forget

Been alone in hurricanes
My life is always
Exactly like that

Water or Dirt

Would cut you one heavy
Gusts to test foundations

Every time of my life
Exactly like those storms

Cept this
Eye-of-the-storm

Sweet wife
Tell'n me it all fine

When I look
Past our peaceful center

To the tsunami
Of the explosion of life

These horizons call'n
To the streets as lone-light
As testament that good-persons

Well I had it coming one-way or the other

Hate much

All-fkd-up

Bays Lakes Rivers
Deep Mountain Ranges

If the earth
As fire itself
Purchase purity

Put man
To flame

Jump in myself
As helpful-log

I love the individual
But I hate the whole

Who are any of us
To create such cost

A witness
Aun villian
Of the crime

Better lived
The natives

Kept by life
To low numbers

All hard-got
All savored sweet

With all these billions
With less extra-ordinary

I don't take
Facts for-granted

So the world is round
A beautiful discovery

Tho ever in daydream
Writing fiction came alien

Essays of things as they been
That was always a great strength

Able to pass me easily
In most classes

Any writer
Who enjoyed fame

Sold their soul
Just at the start

Themself busy
In society bullshit

When hard works
Were owed work

Don't need

Fish'n months
Caught a corporate
$44k/year

Vested-up
First-day

The worlds-best-grad
Popped all-on-the-under
Like I don't know-whats-up
'Oh uh we got
'A job for you

Pages-over-pages
Biggest audits of the corporation
He had been passing off months

In a room 
Full of boxes

Each box wall-to-wall-paper
With only little association

I got my ass-to-work
All about the game

Figured a system
Lingering in the chaos

Lil old man who annouced himself
Watch-shaking important
'What do you think about it

He said himself
Eyeing the horror

I replied vested-up
'I'll have it done
'Before next Wednesday

I could tell
He was impressed
'You think so

Hitting the sinker
'Better to get it done
'Before the move Thursday

I had little idea
If it possibility

Busted my ass
Prayed & got miracles

The owner made sure
I was present at 
All our nationwide-meetings

Only one there able
To take care of year-end-business 
New Years 8:30pm

That muthrfkr fired
All three of my friends
No-severance

Sat us down & told us the news
Told me to lose the vest

I had a red-velvet-pimp 
Tailored Britain imported
Only glad to start the season with

Reworked calculations
100 Million annual thru-put


I found a better gig

When I told my CPA
He was so glad
He couldn't stop smiling
Scared-Id-take-his-job

When I told my mentor
Senior Database Admin
He was so glad
He couldn't stop smiling
Scared-Id-take-his-job

I'm an asshole
People are always glad
That I will no longer be present
I know the difference tween the two smiles

That fish
Was a whale 
& What a ride

Proved more-valuable
Than world-class co-worker

Knew more than the network-admin
Could keep up with the database-admin*

Shameful
To lose ones sanity

Mine lost so many years ago
Out deep in the woods alone

Ever since I have seen
That look of realization
Of a friend seeing me
Caught in shock of a truth

Mask failed the face
Of a deep truth all-along

Since that time
I have lost all friends
Stranger in the flock

To them I look back
Them only ever as strangers

When Im about on
Whatever I go do

Only my mom & sisters
There to get my back

I avoid people
To hide my sanity

Which is constructive
To a low-level-unix-hacker
.
.
.
Life to me
On the gust

Of the flame
Only truth in life

To burn the dead
Is no insignificant feat

The pyre & might
Of the end 
That consumes all 
Most associates as you

Darkness Hate & Toil
Chaos & Running from the cops

Mind unnaturally analytical
Unable to keep still

Passage of life
Turmoil I mold
To mine own purpose

Years of marriage
Tamed as husband

Day-to-day calm
Storms pass by afternoon

Years of happiness
Testify un-paralled-benefits

Unyielded I try
To answer the 
Call of the Wild

Will-broken
Cracked-foundation

Sold-out-to-my-wife

Open scapes of new spheres
Sucess only upon
Return'n to her

Victim of the affection
I trolled Amerith since birth

His attachment to Christina
Kept him from all-ins

He would respond as sidekick
Eye-to-eye as I trolled

~Say what you want
~I dont give a fuck

Christina busy bestow'n blessing
Amerith awarded smile'n unabashed

I give that same look
Master now as apprentice
*
*
*
If Im in it
Its past ability
Max'n credit

I believe choices
Reverberate

My native skill
To see pathways
From here to there

As obvious as trail
On moonless nights
On remote moutaintop

To path that will
Make someone great

Tho those small consequences
Are easily slipped forgot
.
.
.
Not a dream left
fktheworld

No place 
I would return

Humans can be
Real muthrfkrs

Life better with 
Only small numbers

Assholes once here & there
Now only assholes everywhere

Life on planet earth
A world-wide dump

Seems to refresh
Itself as showers

Scrub'n off the 
Scum that is humanity
.
.
.
I never had to take another's life
So I guess at past thirty means
I had a light-hearted life
Opinions never costing
Time of another
.
.

Machete
Tomahawk
Stilleto
Fighter
PECK

Knives still pratical
More than guns
In most ways
.
.

Each year I try
To go more hard

Than ever before
Now past thirty 

Attempt past attempt

Now without ideas
To attempt next

So I keep up on
Unix engineer'n

Adventure boundless
In intellectual ways

All out of faith
Fresh on the floor

Pits of exhaustion
Aun for the energy
Of grand delusions
Depleted fogs dissipate
World openly told

Life been well-played

Best learned off words read here

The day
You break faith

Christina convince'n me
My other little sister
Deep-shit in danger

Present as she shook up
Four police stations

Liscense plate & an hour
Christina sending cops to find Megan
Out up a mountain cabin

I'll sell faith
Right over & out

Caz without a sister
Faith is fruitless

Even if in end
I bought only sam
Megan only after a good-time

Nevermore to shout
! fk-tha-police
With never have'n 
Pleaded to police before
_

Megan last month Thanksgiving
Almost got me arrested
Step'n in on those officers
Trying to game-on my sister

Cops only just handed me
My first break off law in Utah

Officer trying to play ball
Cocky after juke'n Megan

Aun I not straight-brain
My game
Ball all over you plenty

Tho you threaten me with arrest
I'll step in to tell
STFU to Megan

The other officer
Southside-as-well

Content with silent
Laughing at his partner
_

That day of feeling
After the loss of faith

Like the day 
I got married

Bride rized by 4in-converse
Bedazzeled past sanity

Myself pimp-red-velvet-vest
Beard clean as can be

The justice & other lady
Went out of the room
To develope my oaths

Myself sweat'n as she
Made me swear oaths of
Most sacred vows to responsibilty

Past paragraphs in length
Front several witnesses

Afternoon back after courthouse wedding
I passed the-fk-out-till-morn

Whatever faith sold out that day
Worth whatever for returns 
Off one faithful to her

Wife drag'd me to happiness
Pleasantries-only in tasteful-life
.
.
.
Got things to do
Got places to be

Age increases value
Of ones time

Wiser than ever-before
In one's own-way
.
.
.
My dead sister
Contact'n me 

In the same fitful way
As always

This night
Her birthday

'Life is for the living

'Pass on
'You have no relevance here

Mistakes only for living
To recognize the dead

May the waves of my motoions
Pass her on to better plains

To focus on her present
Not on where
She should not interfere

Forgiveness & mercy
Currents towards better-spheres
.
.
.
I need no god

What god
Would have need of me

Just let me be
Out wild & free
.
.
.
A unicorn
Changes someone forever
Aun only in vision

Here, there & everywhere
People confess my beauty

Sad songs
Part'n from just-met-company

I nod reverently
Awknoledge'n such devotion

In promise
Such devotion not-wasted
.
.
.
Drugs are the bestest
*
*
*
Memory liquid as money

Tragedy of humanity
To lose what was known

Despite pleas
Others pass life

Lessons lost
Joys fogotten

I believe all
Gain deep wisdom

In one lot or other
.
.
.
I devote my life

Not to money
Not to whores

But to draw force
In massive amounts

Towards edification
Of one idea alone

One prince alone
Over an archive

Masterpiece & Monument
.
.
.
Hardcore in everything

I don't waste time in hobbies
Only ever immeresed or on bay rest'n
*
*
*
32 Is two years too long

Not that life doesn't get sweeter
As it does every second aggregations

The catastrophic event
Glory of my death 

While I was young
On some far-away-scape

Now walk'n in circles
No dream left in pursuit
Which would take me anywhere
.
.
.
Every night to me
Like the gates of hell

Every night towards sleep
The dark infinity
Anchors to no time

Darkness of it
Forgotten & Remembered

Too similar is concious
Conciousness as computer
Boot each morn
Memory pathways
Now access'n different storage
Than was just the moment before
The memory of it linger'n no home
In a limbo possible to copy to this dimension
In the written story

But I know 
My life is valid

Unless some chemical-imbalance
Rocket onwards insanity
On some scheme or other

In the same unique trajection
Definite in path
A tunnel when turned-back
To see there a definite-course
Since my birth

Always arrogant as a child
Clear idea this was my life

Parents nor authority 
Only myself responsible

So I been on that grind
Since the beginning
.
.
.
Others see me
As mostly a failure

God-awful 
Rants, books & plans

But if they would
Kneel to my ways

They would see a life
Precious aun to higher-powers

Beauty in the scope
Grand off determination

Confidence in decisions
Wings of lunacy

This year three books
Writ in first-draft
.
.
.
entertainment
code
books
art

Free forage
.
.
.
Humanity with its ability
Turn success from failure

Ability to concieve
Usefulness of waste

Masters learn errors
Pleasant surprises to life
.
.
.
Science is best on drugs
When the fog of cloud
Obscures personal dilemma
Saturated by the present

Depths of failures
Cause moutains of strife

Saint Mary lifts me
Dulls pain of existence

Blitzed to ignorance 
I maintain that long & lonely path
*
*
*
Most people don't like me
I take them past limits
They set as standards

Few around me
Only ever hardcore

Where limits heedless
Perspective on alone
*
*

'Our weed is stong
'Be careful

The bartender advised

I looked back cockily
America invented weed

Gotta rep Murica
On forgien streets

Locals think themself hardcore
I keep it obvious

Blitzed obliterated
Front a log staring ahead

Front of me a plant
With a single majestic
Marijuana leaf

Wild beauty
Romance first love

Hour I spent
Cultivate'n springspawn
_

Got hella lost
Found the ideal trail
Got lost again

Bushwacked miles & miles
Went wrong way in the morn
In a loop back

Took a bus back
To where I was

Then kept on mountain road till Sneznik
A trial of the human spirit to persist
_

Adriatic Sea
Italian summer day

Met a local
She instructed me
On the local hustle

Travelers pass-on
To help as locals

Train to Innsbruick
Thru Aples in Blizzard

Lost in a large city 
Not what I expected

Rain, snow & midnight
To find some untame ground

Night a trial of wet cold
_

Europe kicked ass
Beat out dreams for a time

Up at 4:30 to hit that hustle
Only to get by that far out

No plan to catch me
Only added trials thru failure
.
.
.
January month of repentance
For previous year goals 
*
*
*
Journeys are mostly boring
Sprinkled with the brilliance

Of those moments of
Quantum-entanglement

Failure may cut one off
From the ability to see
The entire constellation

As broad guide to one's 
Basic decisions in life

Essential to success
A love of one's life
Intoxication of life

Which one once dreamt
Only a far of island

Conquered in greater capacity
To the fulfillment of reality
_

Master hacker
Master writer
Master adventurer

Neither of which
Ever earned me a penny

With no audience in mind
One deserves no audience

Good & glad 
Is the rest of Peace

Diamonds are experience
Of others in unasked-help

Child of gods
Filled to role as God

Reshape'n the destiny
Of another human-being

The brilliance of the Father
Our original creator

Whom prefers Anonymous
Which I respect
*
*
*
Life is autonomy
Life is sensory

Being is remembrance
Purpose ever imperative

God of unix systems
Mine own hands created

Birth life to process
To its frame in time

Galaxies populated
Thru infrustructure

Communication
Wordless as animal
Howsl & Hoots enough

Internet as water
For fresh files

Internal fields harvest

New nodes like planets
New proxies like moons

Once I only thought
To be a homless non-beaggar

Now as active creator
I mount holy mantles
*
*
*
Sanity is defined
Upon tangible principles

Eyes are bad
Heart ungrateful

Savors of soul
In etheral fruits

What may be 
Aun more important
That what is visible

I follow my heart
In unreigned trust

Most times I am wrong
Mistakes are where miralces lie

Again & again I follow
Vision as terrible as mine
Makes it easier to overlook
All current positions

When my sisters in danger
When my work gets the gutter

Theoretics is all I need
To me that is a pure form
Which triumphs last 

I don't need to save humanity
Enough for me to know that
Now, tangibly, it is possible
For me to bestow back freely
If information is lost

I've turned my back too many times
To those dearest to me & those strangers
In clutches of suffering
Without second thought

Weakness disdainful over all else
Suffering alone breeds strength

I don't pretend humanity
I don't pretend righteousness

fktheworld
& fk you too

Darkness once feared
Now welcome cloak of home

Sith to understand
Good Evil & Neutral

Words of cowards

What is done & can be done
Never heeds definitions

Definitions which entrap
The arrogant to unnatural distortions

Warped by ideas of rectitude
When grasped by immutable forces

Codes are pacts of glory
Decide & follow thru
To the trumpets of victory
Or in payment for wrongs

To all the times I quit
To all the times I kept

Today I swear forward
Up & at it again

Attempt over attempt
Science as life

Theories created only by me
Theories mandated only to me

I don't take principles
I trust no one
_

Revision Revision Revision
Each time with exclamations
Of the ultimate victory

Past hundreds of times in songs
To enchant all to the music
Lead hearts around me to adoration

Christina, Duckie or others
Feel deeply betrayed
When I dethrone myself
To wails of reconciliation
Soon-after I fall again

Assumptions formed from that trust
Of when they entrusted me to faith
A vile aftertaste the sight of me
Muddy, beggarly & cast down
After the next inevitable failure

Light once reflected off diamonds
Dimmed as the stone of a betrayed-wife

A failure doesn't retract success
When work still has not met an end

That lesson they must 
Learn on their own

So I keep no friends
& I keep celebrations

Exhaltations front beloved audieces
Their pupils fogged by internal struggles
To keep a pleasant face as they work
To cast off their faith in my words

Bhielded by pity for me
& Pity for themselves

My dance unabated
Chorus kept true

Hope that one day
They understand truth

Then like dominos
Barriers built tilt
Chain-reaction assured
Each in turn doomed down

In that thunder power
Breach of faith
Which I am confident
Will empower them towards
What they are meant to fulfill
In the mission of their life
.
.
.
Present can never be defined by the outcome
A situation must be captured contained by the moment
Isolation of that experience in & of itself
.
.
.
Too tired
To sit up

Hit life
Breathed back

With the fervor
Post-exodus from womb

Drugs sustain me
Limit after limit

Life ever too long
Burn it as priciple
In bonfires of the day
.
.
.
Daemon independence clavicle
Towards the pinnacle of life

Process life as human
Perceptions that tick tick & tick

Until blackness at the end
Logs as presistent memory

For the benifit of entire race

To interact interally
To interact externally
_

2017 In perfection
Of robust lifeforms

Beloved creations
Of the mastercraftsman

Errors can spread
As system-wide virus
_

2018 towards sesory
Dtrace formulas & parses

Nervous system 
Of intelligence lifeforms

Sesitivity interally of itself
& The host enviornment it lives in

To set itself as benefactor
Towards strange processes around

Symbiotic towards the effort
To keep the system alive longer

Alertness cultivated externally
Actions towards it & of those around
.
.
.
Path to 1337 
Began with honed strategic decisions

Years of failure prepared me
With a familiar brain & habit

Aun the most mundane actions
Still benefit me to this day

Questions became a gnaw
Tantilize'n with time

Master the moment
When the craft of skill
Passed hours into hours
Without break in absolute-focus

Issues like pain
Alert to inaccurate code

Study in code of masters

As a lone wolf
I look to myself
With each action

Anchored in lowest levels
Of computer logic
*
*

I love
Just being me

Alone
Far from consequence

Inhale'n American Spirits
Fourth of July 2013

Out on the glacial spine
Of the Bob Marshall Wilderness

Pass just broke
Into watery Spring

Lost amoung
Saturated trails

Experienced
To find the pass

Else 60mi to 
The nearest exit

Spirit true 
To the roots

Friendship
For me only corrodes

Mastercraftsman dreamer
Insantity with infects

Eye-contact windows of truth
Sharp terror reflected

Dragged to hell
Flickers of pain
In pupil spasams

Awkardly I shift
Accept'n the situation
As celestial seas

Agreed there hover
A mountain of water
Pitch to crash-down

Cant count times
Kinfe in hand

Ready to cut 
Life out a bitch

If any on the jump
Caz out on the streets

Life is for realz
You fk up you die

Boundaries 
Are boundaries

Forget to understand that

I don't converse with you

Unless you are legit

Keep down
On wassup

Game on
Master punk out

Months bleak
From any dreams

Now passionate
Craft'n again
Masterplan
Of adventure
Failed so many times in the past

Past a week
Or only hours

Bitch to fears

The mud
The water

Clouds about
Thick inland

But this time
Prepare'n for win

Where only failure
Fertilize Sith energies

Like a mountain
To break as flood

Consume all to one
Obnoxious & inevitable

Isla Del Rey
I see you the way

Never to be trust
For an easy life

Disasters attract me

Some shit
& Magnetic
In midst I find myself

None who knows me
Can sanely permit
My own definition

Fuction based
On forgien mathematics

Algorithmns alien
To mammilian animals

Future & Past
To me All-in-one

God securely defined
By definite past

Son of god
Apparent in introduction

Blind as natives
Unable to see
So great the definition

Of Columbus ships
Understand'n nothing
Blindness kept recognition

Till humanity

Humility

To return home
To those you knew in prime

Cast inconsiderate
Only Benny & cousin

Then finally Anthony

Reality worn 
All okay

Content only 
With a few things

Addicted
Well aint that a bitch

Says the ignorant

Drugs are only
fk yeah

Good at any time
Good in any era

Only devils
Conspire against

Every spiritual high

I've lost faith
In most things

Just normal day
Pick up next-in-line

Continue my day

Tears & weeps
For foolhardy

Beauty in memory
Cherished as ended-story

Sisters say

No more

Present as Christina
Begged & shook-down
My arch-enemies

Before always shout it
Everytime I seen
Punkass police pass

Hide'n behind the castle walls
Top unconstitutional ramparts

Tho obscured by vehicle
The turmoil of the cop
Apparent in its actions

Pissed
Try'n to keep calm
Tell'n themself
It aint wurf it

Caz I'll make it wurf it

Myself continue'n on no deal
Reigned back chill as fk

Well that is how
It used to be
Nevermore

Since that day I felt
Like I sold my testies

Still I in no way
Regret the deal

Try'n to explain
To the husband

Of which woman
I sang songs

Her have'n politely
Put log on flame

As I breakfasted
Up & out within 10 mins

Offended & dejected

Shit I gosta
Be on mine

Husband drive'n me off the mountain
More out of kindess for his wife

Myself in my own way
Of explain'n my ways
In indirect ways
As to respect confrontation
Those whose life I cherish

Most times
People dont pick up on it
& I am seen as
Quite the asshole

Imagine the trials
Of my wife

Seasoned veteran
Ducki now takes all
In this world

Stone-cold shemale hookers

To be all

Maps censored

Myself as seeker
Of the truth

I broke to bitch
Before hallowed halls

Of the insanity 
Of the Jungle

Last year
Puerto Rico 

Beat ta bitch
Under shadows
Of Jungle horrors

This time think'n
Over all others

I will break her
To be my bitch

Take me as I want
When I want no front

Therefore open
New paths to my ways
.

All poetic doomsday
Riot & disorder

The ecstacy
Only tasted
In its time

Alehuia the savors
Fruit from strife ripe 

To rid the world
Of false fears

To become human
In only native ways

Primal all then
Exalted explosions

Juice above all sweetest
Times to get rowdy
With likeminded loons

Porn less
Hardcore 

Then what I 
Get up on

Beachside night
Air dark
But illuminated

By moon
Reflected off sand

Bounce'n back
Off steady waves

Crackles
Of bonfire flames

Breezy salty kisses
Its warm arms surround me

To take woman
And emulate embrace

Wet entanglements
Of First Love

Hour to the next
Our tongues danced
Under summer moon

Alone to the strech
Of endlessness everywhere

As is our love
Tho together
Now is lost to 
Forevermore
.
.
.
Fate as thunder
Reverberates all
Passive to its waves

Trembled to knees
In respect of somthing greater
.

Riff raff
& I naturally 
Link up
To see wassup

Make powwow 
& Exchange

Remeber that homeless crew
I ran with that day 
DeadHorseBeard  & Bathasalts
Caught up to me

The group said
They were hitchhike'n to Maine
Ambitious from Virginia

Never will know
If they ever made it

They got me mixed up
With the local dramatics

Decades to twist
Shadow into light

Storms to providence

Hopeful at advent
When plan B

Summoned by plan A

Default towards
Crafted schemes

Science enamored
In process

The base stable cement
Of failures set-together

Evolved to revenge

What killed you
Never kill another

As religion is

Pretend to know

Comprehened by beauty-of-it-all

Each instance dependent
On both past & future

Yellowknife
Courage'n myself
To talk to this girl

Gusts from winds
Above th 60th Parallel

Myself obvious homeless

Her smile glinted
Due to my audacity

A corporate-ecologist
Paid to make results
.
.
.
Fear 
I know fear

Nightmares reality

Ducki so sweet
Turns terrible
In shadowy night

2am After 
Monster movie

Something grab'd armrest
I turn the chair

Contorted distortion
Of a human poised
Unnaturally on all fours
As only an asian could

Black viel draped down
Hang'n depths 
As only asian hair can

Cry curled and died
As both sanity 
& Sensibilty swallowed

After a while
My brained checked pulse
& Rebooted

It was only Ducki
Her current form
Comfortable for her
Deep-night-woken
_

After hours of call'n
All over the small apartments

I double searched again
She must have heard me

The third search
Of the closet

Desperate for any impression
My handed opened a box

Hands length tall
From the ground

I lifted a corner flap
Inside I found a foot

It was attached
To a leg which was attached
To my horror my wife

Alive kanive'n caught
In compressed states
_

Ducki morphs sinister
In certain nighttime hours
.
.
.
Only fools
Call on bluffs

I been on hardlines
& Kept to my own
_

Hundreds of miles into nowhere

He left me at Indian Cabins & Liqour
But much later at the 60th Parallel

He passed me 
The conceeded a stop
Eventually

Grateful
Past any past

Alone recognize'n horror
Of the reality
I had got myself into

We powwow
He asked me 
To hold the baggie

I smelt alert
& Knew he was trasport'n

'Sorry I got student loans
'I can't be caught

I hard-eyed him

He hard-eyed back
'I'm afraid if you dont hold it
'We will have to throw it out

I kept to my smarts
'Its like a sin
'To throw this away

The baggy deposited
For mother nature

An eazy escape
To link a stranger a bag
Full of the rest
Of that identical stuff
 
I had noted
It when I first rentered

Fear will never
Conquer my heart

& Thank god
He didn't also
Throw me out
.
.
.
My hard-lined position
At times gets comical

Quebec City
At a bar

I enter

Typical French male
All overfriendly
Next to his female
Who assumes male in 
French-esk relationships

Cast to beautiful
French male forms

His woman
Paid his way

He pulls over a stool
'Sit, sit

With eyes on him
I calmly take a seat
At the end

I inspected his boots
They were manmade
This snag'd my prejudice
He caught me

Pissed he got at me
From his stool drunk & brood'n

'I didn't have time to change
'For the bar after work
'You got a problem with my boots

'Nike shoes
'Nike pants
'Nike hoodie

'What do you work for Nike

I respond back unaffected
Accidentally instigated

'Those are good boots
'We admire boots
'Where I am from in Texas

Later he
Polite in the French-Canadian-Way
Offered me entry into a threesome

There is a wide gap
Twix beauty & arousal

I've admired plenty rocks
But I've yet to fuck one

Christina & I
Above best buds

Teammates against the world
Since she was only a child

Our adventures unparalleled
Easily taking the 23mi
Provo city hike there & back again

Myself knee damage
That took years to fully heal

Or when she was fifteen
Us blitzed stuck in hostels
Promised after darkfall

The large expanse of backyard
& Great Ancient Mango tree

The only people 
Who can get alone with me
People who developed around me

Themself deep in callous

Sorrows fill the well of my sadness

Once I thought I killed her
I forced her to courage up
& Take a large hill longboard
Not even at thirteen
At maximum speed
She speed-wobble faceplanted

I thought 
I killed my sister that day

Her face missed the asphalt 
& Only bounced off gravel

Experiences like those
Is why I feel I am
Better off left alone

Xena warrior princess
My-bet Christina kick 
Her Lawless ass

My little sister
Cast as immortal-god
Who only a fool not worship

So many times
I gaped open-mouthed

Completed outclassed
By her acts

24 & she can boast
Over anyone on the planet

With the only exception
Most of the time being me
_

Exhasparated
I never learn

'Christina
'Jump off the cliff now

She would plead
For me to not make her do it

'I did it already
'I dived in its fine

'All you got to do
'Is not get all cut up
'Climbed out the barnacles

'For-fks-sake
'I had to
'Dive in suicide

She somehow got out of it
Her brother utterly ashamed

Days later
At the Blue Lagoon

Sister who had just
Only read about the fact
This of unknownst depth

Falls blatantly for the 

'Hey everyone
'I'm standing!
'In the middle of Blud Lagoon!

She saws out excitedly
Us swimming over the depths

! Richie
! Richie Look he is standing

I overfilled with shame & shut-the-fk-ups
But to no avail when Christina gets started

Another time as a teen
We walked thru a nice neighborhood

Some guy walks from behind us
& Passes us

Christina in an
All-out fit
Screams & screams
Like a scared dog

So long was the fit
I had the time to casually exchange
With the passing stranger

'Im sorry my little sister
'She gets like that
_

Rocky a traveller
We met at Blue Lagoon

He is lured
To our island
Monkey Island

Finally Christina flirty
Drops her balls & jumps the cliff

Right after Rocky

What kind of lunatic
Would trust a stranger
Over her own brother

These are the lunacies
An older brother deal-with

A world full of haters

Stays true to himself

We lay wreaths fore
Our blonde knight
