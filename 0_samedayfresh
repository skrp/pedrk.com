My sins
Swell unattended

Till
En Masse

Launch in 
Avalanche
_

Never resist massive forces
Sith manuevers the momentum

Detriment to push past 
Until it overflow to power

There to summit
A new stage of life
.

Dick

The name my mother gave me
& She knows me best

As a Ranger
Of mountain realms

It is my obligation
To inform nonlocals

'This a flash flood area

'Stay close with your friends
'Moutain Lions live here

Helps ruin the day
.
.
.
I process data
Pretty goddamn good

This buys over
My odd personality

Task monumental to most
Solved offhand

From my true task of the day
In my day-to-day march to 1337

Aun physical tasks
All mainly machine type algorithmns
.
.
.
A Nation
Bent on 
Worldwide surveillence

Doomed
To enslave itself

Adriatic seaside
I understood

America
The only fate
I seek
.
.
.
America
Bought only a traitor

To whistleblow
On its surveillent state

Not the confession
Of community neighbors
Busy in its subversive tasks

What a day
What a day

When only a Snowden
Cured our ignorant state

A much better hacker am I
& I not a Russian Spy

If the call rise
May it be for my name
Next time
.
