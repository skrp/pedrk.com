El Botanico

A cat refuge
Made out of a
Deep wooded
Deep city park

A place
Only in fantasy

Much can be derived
From this society

Buenos Aires
Valentines Day

The people stroll'n
Lovers in hand

Romance unmatched
A spirit lost
To the modern world

Yet in this
Remote land
Held treasured
.
.
.

I have gathered firewood
All night with a few people

The latest was when I went to Ottawa
For the World Unix Conference BSDCan

Headed to camp in the woods
For the night

I met a homeless
My age
By the homeless shelter

After buy'n weed
He decided to come
Hang out with me
Hope'n to hitch out with me

I warned him it might get cold
But he was Canadian

I taught him how to make fire from a candle
From wet wood

He taught me how to keep a fire going
Until 4am constantly gather'n wood

I gave him $20 to go get more weed
To meet later at McDonalds

Mayhap it was the freeze of that night
Covered in my second layer clothes
He suffered the cold Canadian June night

Or mayhap he couldn't resist
Spend'n that $20

Either way
I never saw him again
I'd get to Newfoundland alone
.
.
.
If the govt is mad at me
Well I accept the consequences
Of live'n a lawless life

It is a part of me
I wish never taken away

Tho I may at times take liberty
In the freedom of my wishes
.
.
.

Dazed & exhausted
From the long haul

When vacation
Is the exact opposite

Now back to the grind
Find it a rest

As the level ground
Is rest from mountain elevations
.
.
.
Most these muthrfkrs
I interact with

Can't fathom
The man I am

Tie'd out
Money at the brim

I just hope
They aren't blind

Cause my eye
Punk out garanteed

Perfected since
I was hardly a teen
.
.
.

The drunk guy
At the local dive

Talked a bit
Of shit

But I found it
Quite the complement

' Dark mysterious stranger
' In the corner

I just gave him
My look

Texans
Never tolerate disrespect
.
.
.
Not a holic
To anything in life

Mayhap
Only the pleasure

Of take'n in
The moment
As if it the last

Peaceful
Is the heart
That die fulfilled
.

Friends & Love
Can be lost long
But will always return
To those who seek

Of all I meet
Not till I returned home
Did I find

Kindred
Sprinkled by Destiny

To waypoints
Of how one should be
_

Many songs writ
& Stories told
Of my deeds

Elijah my closest cousin
His deeds
Only told in first person

Which are equal
In comparison
To my own

How is it
That in my long seek
I find you again

Alone as when
I was a child
Now alone
As an adult
Back home
_

I always disrespected my dad
He would say he was the shit
But he only ever rolled with family

I thought that
The lamest fault of all
Teen in my social height
_

Now with fewer friends
But still friends

Elijah was the only one
I still cared to see

We talked
As I haven't for unknown years
About the same topics
I'd shame my dad for do'n
_

Old age
I know now

Is learn'n
Your dad was right all along
& You played the fool
.

Cuban cigar
Sized blunt

31st Birthday
Hot boxed
With JJ & Elijah

I choked out first
Break'n to chicken
As I rolled down my window

The smoke
A giant cloud
Deompress'n

Over the houses
& To the sky
_

Codine coated blunts
Put me to shame
Tap'n out

Back to back blunts
Put me to shame
Tap'n out

Back to the streets
For my birthday
& I got played the pussy
.
.
.
Wife & I
At different
Strengths & Weakness

Under pressure but
Took me off the mountain

In admiration I said
' I would have
' Flip'd the fk out
' Fk you, fk this, fk everything

She replied
' I work better
' Under pressure

Her research paper due
That night

' Send over what you have
' & I'll help you
I told her in grattitude

I opened her email
It only contained
The teacher's prompt
.

Die Hard 4

If you gonna be 1337
Be loud mouthed

& One day
Some Bruce Willis muthrfkr

Bust in to say
' Let's save the universe

& I'd know
I prepared all my life

Batman knows
Robins
Know their place

A ride to die
Kind of muthrfkr

This wave
Till its end

In hopeful
Total Washout
.
.
.
All I need
One look
One memory

Then they know
Muthrfkr cast
Apart from the rest

Your reaction
A tired route
Tho to you
Unique it seem

Off the wall
Blackest of sheep

Lucifer to gods

Try to understand
I'll laugh at your tumble

White razed black
Latin grown Mexican

American at the core
Not that fat phone type

Southern raised
& Never tolerant
When some muthrkfkn
Northerner think they shit

Fk this federation
Rember the cause

Rebel against
Two Faced Tyrants

Minorities proclaimed free
Tho cuffed they ever be

Not for
Womanize'n

For ball'n over
Weak

You down
Cause you want to be

I up
Thats where

.

Approach'n fear
Fk that

I do what I do
But  never what I'm scared to doo

Shit I been against
Many things I done

But shit its proof
No Fear
After it is done

My first
High school friend
Anothny
' El Feo
As say his family

He & Benny
Us all watch'n
Pulp Fiction

My mom bust in
At the start
Of the ass rape'n

My mother see
Aun Snuff
To me
Know as 'Disney'
The only high schooler
Only allowed to watch 'G'

I could a
Explain'n this an actual movie

Fear fk that
Rather their speculative eyes

At us in 10s
Rise'n from the live'n room floor
Past 10 skip'n school

Never a single female

Those seniors you

Offer'n to cruise
Skip'n school to roll

Northside
The side where we
Can only ever be

So if you aint black
Or those visit'n people
Its too aparent

Pull with their
Old grandmother
Holds strong there
.
.
.
Never disrespect me

Texan
Or Narcissism

I'm gonna call you out
To deal undiscolsed bargins

Cause I'm old
Too old

The best day
To come is Today

Call'd out a muthrkfr
In a mexican bar
Defiant against a nest

Sure as shit
I'm call you out

Your bitch
Cum think'n of me

If she ever sees me
Thats just
Who I be

Not handsome
Manly

Cause she know
Imma fk her-
Like my last

Only to my wife
Like every night

Teach'n these
Slovenians

At their bar
They say
' All we got is AKs
' Not good for long distance

I laugh
' All I care about
' Is whats in front
' Of me up to that railway
( 30 feet)

' Revolvers are best
' Cause you know
' All you got to do
' Keep on that trigger

Shit those
Are'nt meant for reload'n

' But if you expect
' To use more than 5
' You ain't live'n
' Much longer anyway

Americans always
Know their guns

Homeless
To baller

Not have'n excess
But ball'n with
What is given

There the alchemey
Of Midas touch

Life sweet
In American Saturation

Ball'n
But in reality
Give'n back
To the streets

I know the joy
Of a big tip
& If I can do that
I will

The jackass to most
But value overrides

24
Life to up in Arson

Nothing but what
In my pack

None
Not even me
Know what part
Of the states I'm in

No cell
Only a CERT

My back
Guarded only ever
By my arms

Tom cat
From society

Money thrown at me
Cause they know

I know wassup

I throw it back
At the ones I like

Money
Aint shit to me

Where you can
Blunt back to back

If I'd known
My siloette at 31
V & Curvy
In prime state

Old age
Might not have
Become the monster
It is to me now

Shit pants
Happens in adventure

But back out
Unable without assistance

Deserves
The death that comes

But not all
Get what they deserve

Some streched
To torment

Faith
Keeps my chin up

The weight
Of the legacy
Of my past
will secure

Farewell Blazed
In glory of the moment

Light of Heart
To see Truth
.

Virtual Reality
The realm of gaming

To experience existence
As one wishes

As a female
Nightelf champion

I teased
Christina's boyfriend
That he played a girl

He replied
' I'd rather
' Stare at her
' Ass all day

I always
Carried a briefcase
In high school

Cutoff Jincos
& Colored mismatch socks

Colored hair
& Noose wallet rope

In the black school
Northside Hillcrest

I always
Ride to die

On those razor
Edge life styles

Life writes stories
As vivid as pain

In that
Complex & Incomprehenisble Way

Those who ever
Crossed me
Lived in anxiety

Those who ever
Accepted my friendship
Meet me in happiness

They knew I was
A certain kind of
Muthrfkr
Tho garanteed not
The treacherous kind

In any
Social sect

I have explicitly
Been taken in
As a rare oddity

Too blinded by interest
Too see my
Blatant anti-qualities
.
.
.
Cultivated
Perpedicular to society

Adventure unfamiliar
In a net

Words outshined
By the glare

Hackers
Clicked away
_

Against the grain
Black sheep

Often I suspect
This my only motive

Or that it be
Excellence when unguided

Many paths
Numerous choices

Where whim meets wisdom
Subconcious instincts unearthed

Alone
Cleanroom

The reaction pure
Wastes of reaction

In that earthly circle
Action feeds another

Off what is
Left unused

To be always as able
But never squandered
.
.
.
Codine coated blunts
Never again please

Spliffs only smoked
When I forget how much
I dislike them

I enjoy saturation
Of one thing alone
.
.
.
Time precious
Statis maddening

Give me the
Liberty of meaning

To cause movement
On the roll of life

Restrict me
In a space of no progress

Mutex Locked
Waiting that seems forever
.
.
.
Alone
For the first day
Of a month

Doing
What I always do
I guess I love my life
.
.
.
Losers
Rejected by all

Those
My people

Us taken each
As an other

Know'n the
Other is
Okay with what

Not fake'n
It along
With the rest

This is
My legend
No delays

You serve the story
Or we go our seperate ways

Not selfish
Understand'n
Earthly ways

Forced
Execrements shit
Only flies like
.

Not the man
Of my city

That time passed

Ranger
Off the grid

In forgien lands
Full of fear

First time
O'r The Atlantic

Never heard
Of the city before
Vienna

Austria
Think'n they spoke Austrian
The entire time

Slovenia
Made me realize
I knew nothing of Europe
When I seen
It existed on a map

Ljublejaba
What kind a
Odd place is that

When you travel
On the whim

The city desolate
All the words
In that odd austrain language

I aint blind
I know whats up

Shit I always been
Scared of what
I regardless do

Put'n myself
Ever in position

To have to live
With hard choices

You might be cold
Shit'n no paper
In the same
Consistency as their coffee
+

My simple theory
' If I can see it
' I can get there

I told that man
Us alone near
Secluded military lands

His look of
Unsettled incredibility

Due to my
Assured certainty

Tho the storms
Centered on the mountains

Never permited me
To actually test
That theory
.

Trieste Italy

A german man asked
' How do you talk with people

When he learned
I didn't only knew Spanish

' I guess I don't
' Talk to many people

I casually negociated
With the train ticketeer
Him aside have'n
Offered to translate

The path laid out
To Innsbruck

Thru Northern Italy
In May blizzard

Pass'n a bum
Past 10

In a city
I understood only
As a small mountain town

Cold & Rain
Him huddled under
A shop ledge

Those you plead pity
Always fills me with disgust

Cold & Rain
My huddled wet
Under the trees

Hammocks are terrible
In mists
.
.
.
I only do
Lotta talk'n

Cause that why
I walk

Meaning for me
Is pride earned

Fk humility
I legit

Savor our moment
Cause you will
Always remember it

A unicorn
Mixed with a stray
Mangy mutt

Magesty only in the smile
Glad for each new day

Some people are
Too stupid
To see such things

These I have to
Explain myself
Which puts me
In awkward positions
Which I'm entirely
Accustomed too
.
.
.
The internet
Has isolated us

Islands
Alone

Early 00s
I met many people

Now all interactions
Without bonds
.
.
.
Every summit
I find
Lonliness unmasked

Were one thought
Pinnacles of debat

Forgotten grounds
Inmutable boulders

Trees all
Alpine runt

As if you betrayed yourself
Beguiled to a far away desolation

This the true motive
Under it all

Major players
In the unix community

Recognize me
As the loon half-baked
I embody

Deep & cold paths
Snow in proof
Of no other
.

Live today

'Like  its your last
'Or its your greatest

Live today
Only to remember

3rd attempt
To make ridge

Met with quick failure

You only ever
Need to suceed once

This time
Blunted Blazed & Ridgeside

They asked
Of my yoga

We performed
Sacrament

Beef Jerky
No water
Is never fun

Then the chug
Moutain Dew
In one hit

Sunrise pose
Inhale blunt
Rise exhale smoke

Blaine the choo choo train
Let smoke out
Only in small percentages
Inhale'n precentages of fresh
Hypervent out

Among blaze
We commited ritual

Solitary Ridgeside
Elune enshrouded
Late no light

All were blessed
With the cough

Lost deep
In foggyness
Of a lost state

Soul in
Perpetual Instability

Social smog of Failure
Too potent not to be fact

What strikes me hot
Above any understand'n

To others
Neutral Lukewarm
Spew from thy mouth
Away lunatic

But words
Keep flow'n

As long as my biches love me
I could give me a fk bout no hater

Im on that good kush
Imma ball to the day I fall

31 Aint so bad
Fair I see it shine
On everyone

Death I begin to fear
Greater with everyday

Life in that stillness
Caught of heart
As if all the universe
Needs a breather
For what bout to hit you

La Santa Muerte
Loves the surprised

She will catch you
& Your time slowed demise
Will be cherised

Fk Tomorrow
Natural path

If todays effects
Tomorrow so greatly

What greater proof
Do you need
To still do it

Sleep
I'm always an asshole anyway

My birthdays
Spent alone

Surprise Birthday
A wish itself

Alone on some
Forgien ground

But not that time
On that suicide
Ride down the mountain

I made it to Helena

A girl & friends
Greeted me a stranger
At a bar to celebrate my birthday
By word alone
But even such is powerful

Surprise
You aren't alone on your birthday

Tho it the expected outcome
Never been Montana way
.

'The quickest way
'Is not the straight path
'Of mathematics
'Karate

'Tai Chi
'To already be there
A mass of sticky hands

Believed it himself

Breathless moment
When a song
Is understood

Mayhap bypassed
Plenty before

Freddie Gibbs
'Just Tryin' Ta Make it

Birthed in me resolve
That succeed to Sneznik
A journey
That took many days

Against them locals
Aun to sneer
But I suceeded

Sneer me
I just smirk back

You
As the countless past

No where to find
To dance all up on
Mistaken faithless fks

Over the ear

Mayas well be speakers

Up on them streets
All in local cryptic

Bitches on the street
Gonna hear some

What I'd bring on you

Old women
Only need one look

To be told
To very depths

What I be bout

Only ever in tales
Never real to fk you

Then I come in
Roland of Gilead

It ends up being
My decision

Boxer Mickey
'Women make you weak

I dont allow you to ask
It is the regret of denial
That will haunt you everlasting
For have'n not taken
What had been demanded of life

Drama
Excrement of Society

My love is honest
Regardless of my love

That to me
Is my only definition

My sins
Swell unattended

Till

Launch in

Never resist massive forces
Sith manuevers the momentum

Detriment to push past 
Until it overflow to power

There to summit
A new stage of life

Dick

The name my mother gave me
& She knows me best

As a Ranger
Of mountain realms

It is my obligation
To inform nonlocals

'This a flash flood area

'Stay close with your friends
'Moutain Lions live here

Helps ruin the day

I process data
Pretty goddamn good

This buys over
My odd personality

Task monumental to most
Solved offhand

From my true task of the day
In my day-to-day march to 1337

Aun physical tasks
All mainly machine type algorithmns
.
.
.
A Nation
Bent on 
Worldwide surveillence

Doomed
To enslave itself

Adriatic seaside
I understood

America
The only fate
I seek
.
.
.
America
Bought only a traitor

To whistleblow
On its surveillent state

Not the confession
Of community neighbors
Busy in its subversive tasks

What a day
What a day

When only a Snowden
Cured our ignorant state

A much better hacker am I
& I not a Russian Spy

If the call rise
May it be for my name
Next time
.

Life is something
That comes & goes

At the end
I hope as
Pheonix I fly

All flame 
In sudden glory

Then to darkness
Of the night

'Fuck the world
I'd first seen this sentence

On my wife's chinese shirt
Fate's message

My catch phrase now
'Fuck the world

'Fk the world
'How did I mess
'It all up again
Often sentiment
That goes with
My excited smirk
Mania & Lust

Out there
In the world alone

That is what
I am best at

Let youth
Give me the momentum

To fly

Didn't belong anywhere
Bury me best right here

Event at the apex
Life horizons death

Faith
Where I die sacred

It is death
That tells

A man's Tale
.
.
.
Like my Mission
Like my Appalachian Trail

Never once believed
I'd make the end

Now with all false faith
Stripped from me

Failure
The sound of Nothing

After my words
Are distributed abundantly

I just keep write'n
As I kept preach'n & hike'n

Cause the means
Is my favorite part
.
.
.
Ball'n
Is know'n 
How to ball with nothing

Once you get that ball
All well known

Just give me a little
& I flaunt all over it

But like a new car
It gets old

Tom cat life
Streets fk'd up

.
Skills
Matter most in life

Relationships end
Drugs can't create

Money flows
Best fresh like water

Things
All the things I need
I dont really like

Hammock, tent, pack, laptop
Sleeping bag, jacket
_

Been so cold
Thought I was die'n

& Those times
Are greatly overshadowed

What fate
Keeps me upon
Wings of luck

To this day
I knew I hit black

But my peanut skull
Uncracked

I remember my head hit'n
Asphalt at 70mi+

Motorcyle continue'n on
40 Yards

To smash into
A complete total
Against concrete wall

Due to
Wet damn leaves

I always met people online
It is more awkward than it may seem

But I am used to awkward
Home thru the cold rainy wasatch pass

When I got home

Been at that always

Child endure'n adventures

America
Police State

Life under powerful sects
Rule hardhandedly

Administrative Thugs
Unioned Federally

I believed
I would leave

But American is what I am
American to whatever end
.
.
.
Wrote a book
Published a bit

But most I can ever do
Is leave it on a trail

To the side
Underneath what looks to be
A few days drift
.
.
.
Merit means most
To most

I merit much
But now isn't the time

To sidetrack myself
On the petty run for payment

All I need
Is what I can make
A story out of

Now it is an
Archive Mainframe

It has been
Motorcycles 1, 2, 3, -> 4
Osprey pack
1lb Down sack
Work Tie
Scripture Set
Converse Shoes
Trek'n poles

Just give me whatever
I'll figure something out

Appalachian Epic of 3SHOT
MKRX Systems

A hacker weekend
Can change a
Monumental Project

Into a well & done
Right off the back

Plenty of
Coffee

Plenty of
Bud

Guided as if by
Poltergeist hands

Something passing through
As with one last chance
To make amends
That they channel
Through you

I have given
All I had to give
To everything in life

Of this
I am at true peace

Went back home
To Corpus Christi

At my old
Neighborhood grocer
Down the street

It looked like a
Crack Town

People stare'n
Why is he here

It is fascinating
How some things
Never change
.
.
.
It was years
After the incident

Camilla told me
'Yea you did
'You flew over the car

'Oh yea
After the distant memory
Of me fly'n over the car
Fifteen - Twenty feet away
Dazed & Confused
Find'n my way back

All I cared at that moment
Was that Camilla was okay

& That thank god
I decided prudence
Against go'n wild
Down the street
From that light

No Man is an Island

Doubtless John Donne
More alone than 
I could ever concieve

Surrounded by love
& acceptance by
All those around me

Bought by my childhood
Spent in seculsion

Solitude is all 
I ever seeked
Me vs them

It is hard
To accept

Unique
An kinldy adjective countless
Used to describe me

Not till my Mission
Did I understand utter lonliness

Blocked from communication
With only a jackass
Companion for company

Not in Mexico to baptize
On Crusades of Faith

To find who 
Call to fate for faith

Mayhap bypassed
In the ardour of work

Only ever walk'n
Belt too hot to touch

Whiteshirt & tie & kakis

I am just an 
Odd type of person

But I don't see
Much life in any other way
But completely devoted

I read much
Focused on much

Before the mission
I studied this book
Along with the 
Life of Christ

The 10 Commandments
Ten ways a society
Must live in order to survive

Past times after
Empires crumble lost

Tho themselves
Once their slaves

One commandment
Alone for worship

'Dont take
'The name of thy lord in vain

Which I became to understand
The religious backdoor
For control over society

As the Old Testament testifies
There is generally 
A good reason for it

You should not take
Another nations woman

Because soil
Determines the offspring

But which was unheeded
& Led to one of many downfalls

But the ancient way of life
To live as one simply devoted

It is worth meaning
To perserve past hardships

To awaken today
& Revolutionize your life

Worst is starve to death
One is assured to live at peace in

Literally shit out
Of all your luck

Who trusts the uknown
To pay up on credit owed

I got enough loans
To know that never
Works out as planned

So best have a good time
& Help others along the way

Hard choices
To redefine a life

I promised
Would have beautiful ends

John Appleseed
Knows he will never harvest

Know'n fate will take care
Of a few of the countless

To bring 
Appease love shade stability
For generations to come

All worth
If only for two

Tho to what end I can not know
The false hope of a sour granny
Or the sweetness of washington dry

Sow'n is all
I ever really want
To ever do

No worries of justifications
When that a physical impossiblity

Faith not abide'n
The laws of physics

Miracles no science 
Can be sure to define

So I left
A year & nothing

As if so busy
I never stopped to question

In the end 
Accept'n gratefully 
The void of nothingness
A vaccum that gorges all
To fill itself
With all manner of interesting

Faith I bore
Know'n the truth had left
But would one day
Come back around

Faith I have 
On my own found

In a life
Among bretheren

Whether
Physical or intellectual

Leave'n to posterity
Too great to be
Measured in generations

This book on a life
In a manner I hoped
Myself have'n had to recieve

I am 
adventurer hacker poet

& I don't care
Which one of you
Muthrfkrs know it

No man is an island
Did you follow me?

See your way thru
All the bull shit
& Hold the pearl
That is my wisdom

Or like all I met

In horror
Like disgust'n guts
Let it slap to the ground

Better covered gutterside
Under preferred sight of trash

& Thank god
You are all assholes like me
But much less deserve sight of it
Than to consume it greedily

Peaceful & pleasant
I walk faceless

Prince of Archives
Since '14

No longer
About file lust

A greater need presents itself
Independence of Humanity

Our anonymous right

But I look 
To the poor beasts
We eat or slave

A fate
I chose myself

But not one
I'm will'n to
In debt to posterity

Still I affirm
This fate I deserve

The mechanics of its motion
Longsince set

Trump Election
The thunderbolt sent by god
The universe or whatever

To crack open the earth
To be filled by our dead
_

Rattlesnakes
Expect & accept death

Death is the meat
Of its substance

Nobly
It finds death itself

& Sure as shit sticks
Better decapitate

Cause even four hours after death
It may get chance to strike death
Turn'n victor to victim
.
.
.
Preparation
Not only hoard'n

Hone the keeness
Of wiley skill

Live it up 
While it lasts

Long life
Isn't most important

Only to be
How I be

Till its
The end of me

Remembered in thousands
Over thousands of miles

I know how to have
A very good time

Those who partake
Of its angelic levity

Are drawn to a wild
World of rambunctious action

Warrant'n a return
Only in fond memories

Afterlife only
Offers reunion

To me memories
Best left as statues & monuments

To be wizard
Is to create animate
To inanimate

To birth logic
Work'n on certain tasks

Mystic & Wiccan
Spiritualist

Servant of
La Santa Muerte

Father to a new era
Where tech & soul unite

Practice of Arts
Dark to all unanointed

Life is to have
Logic & task

Happiness
Is to return 0

Be independent
Be versatile

PID to heart
shutdown -r now 
RIP

Think'n not of that
Only of what tasks
To busy in

Projections
Via ncurses

Communication
& Reactions

Behold the anew
Craft of Demonology
.

Each day death
More than likely

So each day lived
Like it the last

Punk teen in school
Motorcyclist half nuts
Missionary in escalate'n warzones
Adventurer without sense
Hacker in an anti-hacker state

If I lose sight
Of death

I seem to lose
Understand'n of life

Viva

Hobos 
Know hobo code
Only a matter
Of obvious sense

Bangor
Last days of 
October

The old man looked at me
On the fork to the interstate
Still at a distance
He conceeded
_

Vegas
Days to find
A suitable bush

Of which to mayhap
Find a few hours sleep

Perfect
It would house one
Comfy cosy & secure
Against a concrete ledge

Too perfect
About to settle down
Old man walks up
Still at a distance
& I walk away
.
.
.
One shot
Of me ever necessary

Pure
As alcohol burns

Hits 
Fierce as Salvia

The one time
We meet
Like a needed 
But extremely uncomfortable experience

The seed plants
& May bear zaney fruit
To any garden
Whose heart harbors my memory
.
.
.
In truth
I rarely troll

But my fk-else
You would swear

Spew from a 
Bulls asshole
.
.
.
Faith
A Fervor
Like Fire
Wanes at times

A blaze
Too costly
Aun for forests

Accept
A simple red core

With faith
In the coal
Of ones substance

Bounties of time
Will sing its glories
In latter days

Science

Alchemly to form
Theory to matter

I seek the arts
Of summon'n daemons

robust independent
skilled in motives
intelligent of environment

Sustained on Threads
Scheduled into work

File apparitions
Of its state

Cryptic communications
UDP howls & hoots

Pack like mentality
Ranks of race 
_

Small leak 
Sink ships


Networks
House'n apartments
With federal vermin
Bug their way in

'An old say'n
'In Texas
'That says

~fool me once
~shame on
~shame on you

~fool me...
~i can't get fooled again

Texan is to live badass

Maybe bigger in bias relation
But relations are only relative

So why should we trust 
Your perspective

On how fkn awesome
Texans keep Texas

Poor poor 3Chop
Called my wife
Several times internationally

To get her out
Of cantonese situations

Be'n a big brother
Is a lifetime service
_

My wife says
'What yours is mine
'What mine is mine

I assume it
Works both ways
.

3Chop's farvorite yarn

'Get richie all he desires
'But dont cut corners with the donkeys
'He can always tell if they from Mexico
'& Tho his favorite
'Rare White Donkey breed
'Color Swan purity
'He still fks it
'Like a donkey should be

'Why would anyone
'Want kids

I avoid drama
Caz I get real fkn dramatic

All parinoia & imagination
Flustered as a lil chick

Squak squak squak

Unless its
Hatred terrror ball-bust'n
It has no interest to me

If lost on valley floor
Smooth planes of ease
Stir alien horror

Mountain Pass
Path found

After Doubt & Dispear

Tycoons 
Of energy

Become my surf
All else shit'n
Themselves in panic

Or panic
To the outcome
Of a Last Stand
In lifes roulette

Dark energies blisten'n
To be expended
Forward in rocket
Toward new spheres
.
.
.
Midst of the storm
That blew over 20% of the woods

Dark world
In Armageddon

Peaceful
In heart

Hell
What I deserve

Nice old country maid
Have'n warned me

In a wordless smirk
I assured her
She was a fool
To think one as I
Considered storms
In all but levity
_

Or Up
Mt. Washington

Ranger barracade'n
All in blizzard

Myself enamored
To sneak around

Just like in 
Scooby Doo

All in white
My presence unknown

Miles from anything
Alpine heights
Kept unabashed gales

Each burst
Afraid it lift me

Dunk'd to the pits
Devoid of all
But the push forward
_

Or Down
Selva Lacandona

Out fox'n the
Robed tribesman

By pay'n a local drunk
For use of his name

To the outskirts
Of their huts

Where I darted
On a log
Over a ravine
Miles into the Jungle

Trapped
Like a bug in a web

Hang'n full suspension
Every joint
Held by a thorny vine

Confident as a master
In my compass skills

Naught till I was 
Well into the jungle

Discovered
My compass didn't work

So that plan
Swept to the wind
*
*
*
Ball on strength
Love weakness

Quirks & blindspots
_

Hack'n my heart out
Prose mediocre

Okay tho
Cause the dark Arts

Occult
To most

Teach me
Summon'n of spirits

Ethereal entities
Set to certain tasks

Animate
To the inanimate

Lord 
Of a Universe

& From metal
Create intelligence
*

The worlds 
Takes Texans
Easily as assholes

Austria
Talk'n to whomever

People 
Openly speak to strangers
That which they 
Want to be known for most
