Amicola Visitors Center

I signed in
Pack weight of 58lb

They gave me my only map
A paper route to Springer

Up that intense climb of stairs
A guy hike’n with his wife advised

‘ You only need one shirt
‘ & One sweater

After 3mi
Time to camp

I had arrived to the trail
After a long journey

The salesman at
Sports Authority
Wouldn't let me set up
The tent to test it

‘ I assure you 
‘ The Hiker-Biker II
‘ It has room for two

Claustrophobic knots 
Tied my stomach
As I looked at it

More of a bivy-sack 
Than a tent

I would have to hug my pack
In order to fit inside

An Eagle Scout
I could make a fire 
With only one match

But this wasn't the South
After 45min
I conceded defeat

Paranoid from the lady's advice
I threw all 3 packs of abalone

Out in all directions
From my camp

Think’n it best
Not to concentrate the smell

Nothing was left
For me in my past

I threw away all
That I didn't take with me
In my pack

The night before my flight
_

A veteran to depression
I was prepared
With sleeping pills

To escape the sorrowful night
