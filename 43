 XXXXIII
Dreams

Networks to
Quantum Coefficients

Windows

Fuzzed by ethereal
Borders of dimensions

We bless corelatives
With impressions & ideas
_

Often I remember the past
Tho truth apparent

A clear idea lay
Detailed as memory

Of the situation
Resulted by the polar worse
_

Death
A transcendence

To a dimension
Where life

Rolled better fortune

Divergent trajectories open
Paths end

Do we unite into
The life I live

A life
Of fortune & blessings

That all are
Entitled to enjoy
.
.
.
Remorse unfamiliar
To those who love their life

Work'n Fix'n Implement'n
In all degree
Of Finesse & Concentration

Daily on this unix network
Take'n zane ideas
Applied physically

Of a loon
Stoner hacker

Crisis inherent

Ducki sweetly stopâ€™d by
A smile of settled love

I snap at her
' Not Now

Raid array
In Default

A wrong decision
A clumsy movement
A forgotten step

May wipe out
The entire pool

Terabytes of data

In my hot-swap
/dev/da# Repair

I regret my harshness
& Rejection on her face

Lossless of a way to explain
The deep complexities of
The dire situation I was in
.
.
.
Live'n Fast
To Die Young
Since Childhood

Kept
In the good grace of god
By the comedy of my life

I continue to suffer
This stage

Joints ground to bone
Rattle'n from
Crashes Falls & Overuse

A potbelly full
Of my wife's dedication
To keep me anchored
_

In this
30th Anniversary Rampage

Do I still have what it takes
To do what is worth remember'n

Will my belly
Balance a laden pack

Will the glory of my arms
Shaped by the
Toils of a decade
Answer a hero's call

What lies
To the Northeast of Canada

How will it react
When I land
.
