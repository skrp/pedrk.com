 LXIX
Head'n a group
Of 10 children

Thru the woods
Try'n to corner

Gradma's escaped rabbit

The beast eventually
Secured itself under logs

The hunt called off
& We all went back

A simple people
Who live traditionally

In their puritan garb
.
.
.
Try'n to settle
& Accept the surf

Of what forces
Like tides drive
My wife & me

Normally 
I go

& No where been
All that great

No Valleys 
Of our Forefathers

So I guess
Right here with her
Is better than anywhere

What beautiful scapes
Mountains Valleys Plains 
Forest Ridge Trails
Booundless Roams

Exist on unix systems
.
.
.
Where hasn't
A warrant for my arrest
Been issued by 
The local jackass?

Not many places

Freaks my dad out
When they pull him over

Think'n he is me
That is how I live

Fk the  system
false backstab'n tyrants
.
.
.
Those around
Allow the govt

Total surveillance
Of their life

& So do I
Hell if anyone else
Is there with me

The company of strangers
Always a blessing
.
.
.
I will never forget
The accusative face
Of the homeless my age

' You had a sleeping bag
' The entire night!

I don't know you
Muthrfkr

I told you
I was prepared for the cold

Drop'd him off
At the local shelter

On to
bsdCAN

He look'n like
A train wreck

Gave him a twenty to get bud
& Told him if he still
Wanted to go hitch'n

I'll be at that McD's
At 6pm
.
.
.
Been on many
Foreign streets

None
As hard as me

All the local punks
Outplayed by me

Everynight
Have'n to check back
For creepers

Every car's velocity
In awareness
For a drive by

I been real with the world
Since I was young

I definitely been
On harder streets than you

Allowed to venture
On the back of a First World

These stories aren't lies
& I forgotten
Some of the best
_

The local punks
& I gravitate

Strangers on edge
Each think'n themself
Over the other keen'r

We kick it
For a few
_

Photos filter
Emotions from memories

Hope we all
One day meet again

Such an afterlife
An unexpected delight

Few I have
Wronged in life
That I don't burn
A candle in remembrance

Those that have wronged me
Are readily forgiven

Such a fate
The homogeneous
Basis of human faith
 _

At the smell
Of Death

Unfiltered Belief
Will rise

To me

Next
Is not expected

Only the cold bite
Of an utter-end

If life's work
Is blown away
Traceless

Well
I only do what I do
Cause that is just
What I do
.
.
.
Disbelief
An honest compliment

You

Check'n facts
& Proclaim'n it impossible

Keeps me superhuman

That is the foundation
Of my irritate'n smirk
.
.
.
My pathmake'n
With the Native flow

The mechanics of my movement
A fluid physiology of the go

The pendulum
My CHI at the center
 _

I know to track
I know to survive

I know how to start a fire
I know how to journey

& Most of all
Master of the Hustle
_

One of the few
World Class Adventurers

Most have done amaze'n things
But that is all I do

There lies the difference
Between me & you
.
