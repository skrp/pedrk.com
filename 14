I studied maps of the
American Wildernesses

The Selway
I chose as our most wild
_

The nights
A cold Hell

The Ground leeched away
Heat & Sleep
From my back
In timeless torture

Eventually I added
Leaves & Scruff
As insulation to lay upon
Only to discover

The Air leeched away
Heat & Sleep
From my front
In timeless torture

My rations
Honey Soup Garlic & Cheese

Unable to kill naught
But a Rattlesnake's Mother

At the dusk of Winter
Before the teach'n of Spring

The Universe gave a Child
An unlikely opportunity
To retain heritage

The Mother & I fought savagely on the cliff

Unable to shoot with my rifle nor pistol
Against the bare rock of the walls

I set at it
With my Navy Seals knife

10 long minutes of battle
Exhausted my available techniques
Into a shameful stalemate

Then I followed her glances
To a boulder nearby

She saw me look at it
With greedy eyes

I took to it
For a cheap win

With both hands tug'n
Then expose'n

Both
Den & Child

The unjust demands of life
Bade it
Bite or Run

A proper strike
Would have saved both their lives

To my death's remand
The Child fled

Consequently
He smelt the cook'n

Of his mother roast'n
On a riverbed fire
.
.
.
Alone I wander the world
No friend to match my pace
No gaze parallel to my own
A solitary pane of reality
-

In gather'n nests of hackers
None find I familiar

Adventurer tales recounted
Lack true grit

The written word
Our contemporary selfie
-

Why does the caged bird sing?
Channel'n bottled energies
Towards an Inter-Species melody
.
.
.
â€˜ Boys will be boys
An elderly lady justified

Green spiked hair
Handmade punk vest
Jinco Jeans
Cut off at the calves
Held up by a dangle'n noose
Boots for stomp'n

I guess I was the peacock of the bunch
But that didn't take out
Any of my kick

Dangerous
Mothers run'n to cover their children
Men avoid'n my gaze at all costs

Cops
Security Guards
Thug bitches

But a truck of rednecks
We run from those rich-bred & fed
.
