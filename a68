Glencliff Post Office

My motorcycle jacket
Await’d me with supplies

Family always support’n me
_

At the store
Near a large missile

I discover’d 
I was near broke

The worker return’d 
My entire resupply

There only just enough
For a small hot burger

Which I immediately
Drop’d outside

I hate chew’n
Loose Gravel

A journey of native legend
Pass’n much height 

To reach a place
Of Mars Landscapes

If you don’t
Properly prepare your tarp

The White Mountains

Two dogs
Fight’n till
Blood & Gore

On the edge of an
Eagle-Eye Cliff

A battle rarely seen
& Treasured by me

At Chets
I found a rain shell

This essential last piece
To battle winter with

One of the lodges
In the Whites
May have been left unattended
In the rain

Allow’n a rat or two
To restock
On Oatmeal & Sugar

Lake of the Clouds Dungeon

Hoosh led us thru the storm
To summit Mt. Washington

Under conditions
Carns hardly visible

White & the blaze of wind
All caught in 
Howls of frost
