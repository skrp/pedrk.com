The first trail town

The break of wood into Community
Coarsness smoothed out into Society

Its neat pathways
& Goods To Go

Its connectivity & curiosity

To break into such wonderlands
Makes me always
Trot the last miles

Sit'n at the computer
In the Outfitter

Finally contact’n people
Who had no way of contact’n me

Roadwarrior passed by & recognized me
Stop’d to gape stoopified

He arrived last night

I was leave’n after 2hr
He decided 
He would move as well

I purchased an Elevation Map
Now we were on more 
Even grounds

There are dry areas
Where ants make their home

These are conditions
Where they thrive

Barren & Flat

Unfortunate traps for 
Unwary settlers

Large & Red

Ants fight in unison
& I never show mercy to thugs

Ecosystems repeated
Each with individual flair

That sets them 
Unique in the universe

Grove of Mountain
Meadow of Valley
Passage of Water

All fine rest'n places
For any soul
Await'n Eternity

The trail binds
The Destiny of strangers

The unlikely 
Is commonplace here

People intersect miraculously

Today HillyBilly ate lunch
With Day hikers 

He met last year
At the same spot
On the same day

HillyBilly warned me

Taste’n mushrooms
To determine if it 
‘ Tastes Nutty
Is a sure way to be poisoned

The Tennessee Mountains
Retain a Southern Spirit

It is one
Wild & Harsh

Yet without 
Treachery or lies
