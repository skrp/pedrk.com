Bathsalts cut off his straps 
To save wieght

He used only 
Space blankets for warmth
His sandals tore into him

I christened him Bathsalts

He would douse himself in
Talcum Powder Regularly

That night he advised me
To ditch my 
Electronic shaver
To man beard it

Leave'n Neels Gap
My pack weight: 24lbs

Before I left 
I asked the workers
For advice

They troll'd me

‘ I started way 
‘ Earlier than you
‘ & I barely made it
‘ You won't make it

He was the first
To put me on that
Ruthless pace
Countless would echo

Drive’n me
Restlessly forward

The predatory behavior 
Of outfitters is despicable

Convince’n that without ’right’ gear
You wouldn’t be able to hike

They rather see you spend
Your money there
Or go home defeated
