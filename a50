After the library 
I went hustle'n

A girl at 7-11 
Said she would pick me up
At that corner at 3:00pm

True to her word she came by
& Took me to resupply

Moist breezes
& Sandy beaches

Get'n high that night 

My first group of
Thru hikers
V
V
V 
Pristine gothic views
Warped suddenly 

As the city fell away
Midnight by the tracks

I warned a hiker
To not sleep by these tracks

I know what those bring
This being a place for crew changes

Stop’d lakeside 
The moon bright

One from a group 
Approached me

I had to assure him 
In Spanish
' Yo no soy policia

Those that travel by train
From long journeys
Wearily worn
Hungry & Not-Have’n

A black rook 
Bound this place

An eerie atmosphere
Akin to its history

Travel’n a lightless path
Voices to the bushes

Find'n my way thru
Dangerous underpaths

Up the mountains I saw
Signs of hobos still

Up & Up 
The mountain  
Continue’n the climb

Traces of campsites 
Still Here & There
Burnt tins & beer bottles

Late I reached 
A mostly flat boulder
Upon which I slept

The sight of a new color 
I don't remember

But the sight 
Of a new animal 
I can

Down an overgrown side path
Lay stone circles
Demand’n powwow

Soon I had to get out
Baby carrots

A baby goat 
Came waddle'n by

My mind twerked

The baby goat
Had a baby boy

Miniature Moutain Goats existed

What a revelation
To those that love Hobbits

This mountain could inspire
One such as JRR
