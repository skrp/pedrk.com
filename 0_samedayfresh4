If I'd known
My siloette at 31
V & Curvy
In prime state

Old age
Might not have
Become the monster
It is to me now

Shit pants
Happens in adventure

But back out
Unable without assistance

Deserves
The death that comes

But not all
Get what they deserve

Some streched
To torment

Faith
Keeps my chin up

The weight
Of the legacy
Of my past
will secure

Farewell Blazed
In glory of the moment

Light of Heart
To see Truth
.
.
.
Virtual Reality
The realm of gaming

To experience existence
As one wishes

As a female
Nightelf champion
_

I teased
Christina's boyfriend
That he played a girl

He replied
' I'd rather
' Stare at her
' Ass all day
.
.
.
I always
Carried a briefcase
In high school

Cutoff Jincos
& Colored mismatch socks

Colored hair
& Noose wallet rope

In the black school
Northside Hillcrest

I always
Ride to die

On those razor
Edge life styles

Life writes stories
As vivid as pain

In that
Complex & Incomprehenisble Way

Those who ever
Crossed me
Lived in anxiety

Those who ever
Accepted my friendship
Meet me in happiness

They knew I was
A certain kind of
Muthrfkr
Tho garanteed not
The treacherous kind

In any
Social sect

I have explicitly
Been taken in
As a rare oddity

Too blinded by interest
Too see my
Blatant anti-qualities
.
