 XXXVI
Corpus Christi
No place like home

Same corners
I peed on as a teen
Those punk years
Never to be forgotten

On hard streets
Mostly at the bay Downtown

Forever to yearn
 Those warm salty drifts
Stinging with sand

Full of the caw
Of that great body of christ

Its proud Skyline
 & Harbor Bridge

Splashed
By forever muddled waters

Celebrate'n New Years
With a discarded Christmas Tree
Set up in sand & adorned

With Gas & Explosives
A Herald to a new cycle
.

1337
Long eluded me

A child built on DOS
Distracted by the colorful windows of 95

Punk teenage years squandered
In the hustle
Of illicitly-traded binaries

Attempts been made to rise up
Yet the time wasn't right

College years came by & went
Still the time wasn't right

The January summer spent in Buenos Aires
Nose down a dense unix text

Fresh blind'n despair
Those 6 mo of unsuccessful installs

Tho hampered by hardware
I found myself at a FreeBSD terminal

Despite 900 pages
Of technical reads
I could produce
Only DOS commands

That was when
I swore off the 1337 dream
Forever

Squander time no more
Against obstinate deficiency
_

But nothing lasts forever
Stubborn
& In the pits of esteem

Work'n underpaid at a firm
Finally Stable & Able

The time was right

1337
 Come'n forward with vendetta

Noob foothills where
 I had spent my history lost
Now obscured
By vast expenses

Depression & Trial
Still carve my path

Tho the mantle of Disdain shed
Never to be worn again

Now worthy of 1337
Now relieved
I never kept my word
.
.
.
1337 haqr life

Consume’n free time
Exchange’n needful time

Need’n above all else
To reach respectful heights

Where ability
Has become craft
Evolved to skill
Soar’n to masteries
_

When all around
Is Gone as rot

May this archive
 Fuel the future

As the Stegasouraus & Fern

Fuel this CBR 1000RR
Allow’n unimaginable escapes
