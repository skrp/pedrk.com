w at the 
Mt. Washington Train Station

The torrents unrelent’n outside

In the janitor’s closet
There is a hidden compartment
At the very back
Where to hide

Tho high from fumes
I sat there with the 
Last of my food supply
Some jerky

In that nook till close
Read’n the 
Once & Future King

9pm 
Nobody around

I scale the difficult barrier
Into the food court

Joy unmatched I partook
Make’n myself food
As I saw fit

After much trial & error
I haul’d a trashbag
Full like Santa

Over the barrier
Out to the woods
V

V
Up Mt. Washington 
The third way
Treasure laden

The morn 
Full of cheer

Creek laugh’n 
All the way down

Bird’s play’n
Whimsically

From tree to carn
To Mt Washington summit
