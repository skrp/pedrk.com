The trail too deep
The season too harsh

Alone & Over-exhausted
I made my way 
Over fallen trees

I came across a couple
On the trail

They were also
Headed to the restaurant

A fabled buffet
Which would cost me 
The last of all I had

Many warned me
To not skip this stop
_

There we discovered 
The storm knocked out the power 
It was closed

Feel'n very relieved 
From the stress of wallet

I asked them 
For a ride to
Whatever city they were go'n

I desperately needed 
Lekki Trek'n Tips
Mine were worn to the rod

Drop’d at the outfitter in
Downtown Roanoke

The girl work'n 
Gave me free Lekki replacements

Her friend came by
One of a set
 Of Identical Twins

He invited me outside 
To bash some melons for breakfast
Which seemed too odd to decline
_

We roam’d the city
Like a local stray
Pack’n up with a wild animal
Just come in that morn
From its wilderness

Greg invited to a party
At a millionaire's Lake House

In the smallest car 
That fits on the road

One Two
Three Four Five Six
Seven of us fit

Me in in the trunk
Of the tiny hatchback
