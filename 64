 LXIV
Pale
In a black school

First year
Among last generation

At Driscoll Middle School

Always out with those
Church guys on bikes
Suits & ties
Seen several times

Peanut
The bottom of the barrel
Thought he’d stand on me

Fortunate to be able
To make a statement
Out of the weak

I am always
The mysterious type
With no known history

Eager to introduce myself
With a rukus
_

Known as Mormon
The kid preach’n religion

A school reknown
For gang violence

Handsigns & symbolism
A powerful tool

Aun the females
Formidible foes
