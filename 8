 VIII
Those who have
fame & honors
poser ass muthrfkrs

Here
How I am
The way I live

This is the
Pinnacle of humanity

No respect
Nor admiration

Pure from fame
Still got game

 I forge a legend
In spontaeous bursts

This life
Is not a choice
Only a reaction

A catalyst towards combustion
When paired to most environments

All torques violently
Where it receives me

Since no one else
 Is go’n to write my Legend
You get this autobiography
.
.
.
In day-to-day conversation
This past year
People commented

' You don't stink
‘ I thought you would stink

Yeah life got rough
I been at the bottom

Still
The top is always up

2015
Sup
.
.
.
Now I face a dark stage
I am nervous about my
 Journey to the jungle

Streets weren't safe
Preach'n wasn't safe
Trail wasn't safe
Road wasn't safe
Ride'n isn't safe

Technically
If I find a suitable water source
I should be able to survive

Technically
.
.
.
Word to my kind
Who died

Happy High & Drowned
In that lake in Maine

Leave’n 420
As your last written words

Leave’n this life
In Cold’s shock

Glad you went a peaceful way
Tho your company
Would be appreciated today
