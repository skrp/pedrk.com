 XVIII
4am
On a winter's night

A night spent explore'n
The limits of the trail

Something came off the mtn
Its echos follow'n our own

A dark form stalked up
To the boulders at our back
Yet at a distance

We fled into the outer city
To drink from a sprinkler

It prowled over the highway
Follow'n

Head'n back to the canyon
30min later

On the other side
From where the beast
Had crossed

Shadowed by the headlights
Of the only car
Out on this abandoned stretch of road

Creep’d the form of Mtn Lion
In my blind spot
Perch’d to pounce

Scared across
Into a parking lot by the car
The Mtn Lion drew cover

Scared across
The wide pavement of the highway
Amerith & I flew

A quarter mile later
Forced to go the long way
8mi Around

I walked over
A sleep'n homeless
The Mtn Lion likely still tracked us

Remote still
This place above the tracks

Try to explain that to a homeless
Who didn't even accept money

Offered in an attempt
To pave a way to explain
The dire situation he was in

Better off he just not know
Nor feel regret at not believing
The story of a killer beast
.
.
.
If on a rainy day
You caught shelter
During the intensity of the storm
In the underground tunnel
Under the road

Huddle'n there
You saw me coming

Large umbrella
Enshroud'n a bearded man
With a Hi-Tech Nike jacket
All black & hooded tightly
Expensive jeans & kicks

Ask'n you what time it was
I approached & I passed
To allow your nervousness relief

But then stop’n
At the other end
Of that dark & deep tunnel

I asked again
‘ What time was that?

‘ 4:20
You respond again

‘ Oh well
‘ I got to be getting back again
‘ Sorry
I respond in answer

Apologize'n
Because of the fear
Left forgotten on your face
Endure’n the suspicious repass’n
.
.
.
Yes

I've been told
I'm Self Absorb'd

Still
Don't give a fk
