 LXI
Mountain summits
Barren to provide beauty

When all proximity
Out of focus
Against a panorama

To see vast scapes
Past horizons of the eye

& Not comprehend
How far you gone

To gaze vast scapes
Ahead of the infinite

& Not comprehend
Where you go
_

The end of day
When the Earth
Uncovers the truth

Back to the blind'n blaze
Of self-centeredness 

There a cold hope
In distant actors

Upon time-swept tops
Look'n up

Blessed by westwinds
& High altitude exposure 
 
Rest'n assured
That someone in the Uni
Knows what-the-fk
This all about 
.
.
.
To bind the Universe
With sacrament of oneself
 
Rite of physics 
In low level powers
 
Encapsulate'n the energy
Of oneself in record   

To faith in fate
& Settle in the mud

& Preserve yourself
Past an ungrateful era  

To a latter day
Then to be glorified

In all the ecstasy
Of an explorer's discovery

& Then in revelries
Be treasured as deserved 
_

To preserve experience
As fossil record

One must live life
 Worth the effort

To be preserved

One must write
In a manner worth read'n

  Songs encapsulations
Emotions of experience

 These tales
Simple anti-charismatic slurs

Drunk
With adoration of oneself
.
.
.
The rare windows
Of Peace

At the twilight when 
The age of man
Is to be refreshed again

Tides of innocent blood
Purchase atonement
For sins of fathers
 
To birth anew
A sweet age of humanity

Until it grows 
Old & Warped

And the Age of War 
Again ensues retribution
