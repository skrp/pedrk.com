 XXV
‘ Beware: Do not feed the monkeys
‘ They form gangs
‘ To rob people of their food

Monkey Hill
Hong Kong

My quest took two afternoons
End’n as I crossed the bridge

To a hill full of monkeys
Who needed a champion

The Historical Sign read
The monkeys were imported

 To eat the poisonous plants
Around the riverbanks
In order for this area to be founded

Now this Beware sign asks
Abandon the monkeys
To forage on their own
_

I've always wanted
To be a gang leader

Befriend these packs of monkeys
With a feast
They would recognize my value

My pack was full
Of different foods
I'd been accumulate’n
For this celebration

The monkeys may just raid
Me & my camp
Attack'n me in the night

The monkeys may just like me

They would recognize my friendly power
& Unite under my scheme'n

Either way
This was to be a party to never forget
_

Above a shrine of stone
At the point of a foothill
I set up camp for the rain

My 2nd hammock lashing
Was not in my bag
Was not in my pack
Not anywhere to be found

That slight piece of equipment
Would betray me of shelter
From the hard rain to come
_

Head'n from Monkey Hill
Back to downtown Hong Kong
 1:30am I wandered directionless

Earlier Ducki commented
She always wanted
To enter a building
But was too scared
The Indians were always fighting outside

Sure enough
As we entered
A flock of seven Indian males began fight’n

Like small sparrows
do in a bicker

-

Now across the street
Was that same building
An Indian approached me

 With an offer I could not refuse
My own room for under $30

Sure enough
He had to fight against another Indian
But he got us to the elevator

I'd never been on an elevator that small
That had to go so high
.

.
The black Jamaican
Hosted us in a room
The room had a painting

A quiet night of a white family
Dining in their home
A black man poised
With a rifle outside their window

The painting read
‘ Never Forget
.
