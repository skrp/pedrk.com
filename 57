 LVII
Why does the caged bird sing

I think that now as a caged bird
Unlike the other limp dicks here

I extended & then returned
To this inevitable dystopia

Will my brethren rise?
Or stay soft under their Oppressors

I sing how I want
Out open cell windows

Cause Fk You
You taken all but that
.
.
.
Nothing to lose
Thirty now

Have'n dreamt
Tried those dreams on

Still Alive
Walk'n from those wrecks

As a man does
After the taste of Death

~ Any location good enough
~ Any sacrifice eazy enough

Cause live'n on borrowed life
Is much better than dead
.
