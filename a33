The storm fell’d
20% of the trees

A storm unique
In recorded history

Despite the blockade
I continued 25mi days

Despite Climb'n & Trip'n
Over Branch & Tangle
_

There were plenty of creeks
To dip into

Nothing more pleasant 
Than a watery glaze 
Accented by Midsummer's Breeze

Virginia Blues
Hit in a haunt'n way

What great & necessary need
It is to see another 
Human being

Days without such sight
Puts me in a panic

Upon those barren
Ridges Gaps or Valleys

In the deep belly of Virginia
v
v
v
Of my experiences
The wilderness I cherish most

Tho in times of storytell'n

It is the personalities 
Of those I meet

That give my story character
V
V
V
The Virginia Summer Sun
Whose feverish ridges
A lash of swelter 
Upon my back
_

Over-exhaustion 
Always hits me
With the flag of 
Over-dramatics

All is woes & wails
Until I catch my banter
& Settle to rest
Wake’n to a bright new day
