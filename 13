 XIII
Over 10 long years
I wrote
Over 10 long years
It read `gibberish`

Now at the cusp of 30
The bud has bloomed

The petals of mastery
Set in place & color
_

On the Jordan River Trail
Meander'n among paths
Thru summer reeds

Calm'd by the smell
Of the stale decay

My red pen poised
Cock'd to make
The first mark of many

Tho as I read on & on
Each page
Came & went unstained

The words sang
Songs of Myself
A voice at a tune
All my own
.

Jason Stevo Isac & I
Captitalized on the custom
Of gas stations

To stack 12 packs of coke
Outside their glass walls

The outside is the side
To which the rambunctious
Lay claim
_

In one elaborate scheme
We hop’d over one fence
& Thru another

Form'n a Daisy Chain
Pass'n the booty under & over

Run'n hands full
Back to the Get-A-Way truck

We charge'd with the exhilaration
Of the unlikely success of execution

Jason our resident
Get-A-Way-Driver
Stood casually outside

His elbow
Prop'd upon on the hood
Of the Red Izuzu

Go! Go! Go!
We clamor

‘ Can't we got a flat
Jason responded cool
As if a workers union
Protected him

We got away
5mph Down the street
To stop & change tires

That day was canonical
Before we rampaged Downtown

The owner of that car
will drop his jaw
When he realizes
The reason the car won't go

Is because there is a vacancy
Where the battery should be

We four continued on
To a remote haunted airfield
Long abandoned


There find’n a couch
Also abandoned

Lit a bit on fire
Which escalated into a bonfire

In the middle of
The Texan plain
_

Out back in the wastelands
Drink'n our cokes

We enjoyed the view
Of the distant Firefighters

Elementary

Spin’n the globe round
Love’n to slightly press
Let’n it stop randomly

Ask’n myself
‘ Would I go there someday?

Newfoundland always a yes
Remote & To-Itself
.
.
.
Showers

Relishment of renewal
Refresh’n Body & Soul

Cleanse’n off daily scum
Sleep’n naked in sack
Cozy & Peaceful
_

Those years in Mexico
Heat’n the water year-round
With Bucket & Hot-Iron

From Spring to Winter
In the Appalachians
Puddle or Cold-Spring

Out on the streets
Carry’n heavy sack
Civilization at Fingertips

The crave of
The comfort of
Familiarity
