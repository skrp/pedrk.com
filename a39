Settle’n doesn’t happen
Until 2min in sack

Much to be done
Before then

The last act
To climb in

To settle still
To a days repose

First it is one
Than many
Itches all around you

Prod’n you 
Out into the night
To new grounds
Less popular
_

Noseeums
I curse your kind

Humanity is go’n 
To one day destroy you

Callus on the 
Adventurer heel

Is a favorite snack
For baby fish

Take’n advantage
Of the local soak

The James River

That bridge proudly built
Locals & strangers together
Jump’n off

I do not know much about King James
Is the joy of this river
Symbolic of his life

Do you deserve
Such Legacy
