2017 
Snow Full Moon

Up Grove Creek
in the 
Uinta Mountains

7:15pm Blunted & Wait'n
On the sage promise
From last week's bag
Of Fortune Cookie

Weepy Lunar Orb

You break
Peaceful clouds
With tears

Why do you weep so
Sad mother of the night

The work of 
Sun's day troubles so?

A weep
Tender & Gentle
Infinite & Horrible

_

Not the typical wimpers of 
The Uinta Mountain Range

An experience 
Familiar to me

Short prideful emissions 
Of day-to-day sorrows 
+
+
+
Boon of Elune
Thank you 

For all that you do

Haze of light
Penetrate ddepressed clouds

Paint'n life
A shade of deep blue

I swear to Enlightenment
A path on which

You have long
Seen me thru
+
+
+
Snow Full Moon

Ice galaxies 
Of crystal clusters

Hum the glory & love
For the boon of Elune

At a precious alignment
To visit among us

I see your light
As it focus in

Over my soulder
At the writ of my hand

Dart'n too an fro
In the corners of periphrials
_

Grove Creek

Creek of Uinta Mountain
Shout'n all the way down 

Not alone
Tho Alone in the wilderness

Late Wet & Cold
+
+
+
Elune's weep
Calms into a foggy haze

Reborn by baptism
From reconciliation waters

Young & Inspired
Of what is yet to be

3Shot & Christina
Blazed Up

' Practice your machete
As I practice my tomahawk

She would not listen

The next morn
Battle'n the copperhead

3Chop kept miss'n
.
.
.
I took a
Selway spring-born rattlesnake
From its mother

 All the moutain
Lies for your kind

Death to the arrogant

That choose to settle 
On our straight & narrow

Now a foe Bambi knows

Where & 
Where not to go
.
