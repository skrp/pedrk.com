Slayer had taught me
How to fold my bandanna
Around my pot

To keep in check
The crud from grill-less fire

Unfortunately my bandannas were
Pattern'd on camouflage

I overlooked my pot 
Leave’n it in the Shenandoahs

The Sunday Lazy Breeze
No matter where you are

The planet takes Sabbatical

On the Corpus Christi bay
In the Wasatch Mountains
On dusty Mexican streets
Upon riot’n cobblestone
Of Buenos Aires

Now the Appalachian
Meet’n easy tunes 
With eazy steps

Trippy in the woods
All out for all I care

Shout’n Ramble’n Sing’n

On Annapolis Rocks 
I tread

None as far as I can see

Under vast sky
A lake glitters brilliantly

The view of cities from 
The mountains

The proper perspective
To trip to these heights

I found a 1lb 
Discrete Mathematics book

Despite many tries
I failed to find time 
To read much of it

After 1mo I had to ditch it
