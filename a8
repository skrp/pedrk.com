At the end of the day
I found a shack
With someone in it

Rambo II
Christened After Rambo

The original
A black guy with a bow
Play'n around 
Nearly hit someone in their tent 
With an arrow

Needless to say
Rambo had to leave the trail

Rambo II begged him 
For his food supplies
& Named himself Rambo II 
In gratitude

Now he sat patch'n his feet
With duct tape
V

Like me he had a slingshot
Like me he had to hitch in

Unlike me
Rambo II slept in bushes

He explained
This building was a shelter

Many of which 
Were scattered the entire trail

I gave him some of my ammunition
He gave me cat can 
& Cube-fuel
To use as a stove

I don't think Rambo II 
Ever left that shelter
