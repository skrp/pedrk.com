FrightTrain

Cause nothing stops him
Climb’n up

I test’d
He won the race
Indisputably

Always give him
The right of way

I came to a creek
5ft wide 4in deep

Cleverly
I lept to the tree
At the oppose’n bank

Grasp’n to its trunk
With dexterity

Together 
We slowly sank

Till I was
Arch’d back
Head 4in from the cold water

I could only
Release

Caratunk ferry closed

That ferry ride
Essential to continue the trail

One of the milestones
To the fact 
I could not succeed

Meet’n FrieghtTrain 
We Beak & Enter 
Into an unoccupied building

There we found a map
Find’n a bridge to the East

In faith we went right
Only a long forest road

After several hours of trial
We got to the bridge

Heads of Bucks
Lined the wall as trophies

At the Caratunk gas station
Celebrate’n the conquer

I ate pizza
Stare’n at one in particular

A Prince
His prime cut short
Majestic & Gray
The spectrum of color
United in Symphony

Later a man
Point’n coincidentally
To the one 
I admire’d

‘ I got that one 
‘ All the way out in Utah

The easy 10mi 
Hike into Monson

Took me all day
At times crawl’n
Tho it a flat lakeside

Monson
The last of the trail towns

I woke that morn
Next to someone’s compost

3Chop perfectly execute’n
My last mail drop
