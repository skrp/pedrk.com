Pills

As I walked out of the gap
I came upon a weary traveler

The no-longer-white shirt
Bore testament to his tales

‘ Came up here from
‘ The Florida Trail

‘ There was always too much water
‘ Or not enough

‘ I once had to filter water
‘ From a Rest Stop toilet

‘ Within a week of live'n in Florida
‘ I went into pills
‘ It’s bad there

‘ Started shoot'n pills 
‘ Within a week

‘ I lost my job
‘ As a data analyst 
‘ Six months later

‘ I'm out here to
‘ Redefine myself

The only Veteran Stealth Camper
I ever met

Get'n to the pass
That would get me to a Walmart

Passed me
Like a powerful draft

A day hiker offer'd 
To drive me to town

He have’n just arrived
About to embark
On this beautiful morn

Who would I be 
If I took that hour
From a sap

That had to go back
After he enters
