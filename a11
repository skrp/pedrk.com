 Thru hiker

 Only those
Who walk from
Springer to Khadadin
In one unbroken path
_
Section hiker

Anyone that didn't do 
That Thru
But had hiked
More than one day

Day hiker
Those are our prey

Thru the day
I lost some things
Mayhap you come across 
A few blue pans
Or 4lbs of 
Lentils & Beans

Only 10mi in
At a beautiful clear'n

Lay a shelter 
With a clear spring

DHB & Bathsalts
Already settled

They asked me to stay
It would be rude to refuse

I melted in my water bottle
Tryâ€™n to make them Hot Chocolate

I fell asleep after the fire
Made by DHB

Food that can be eaten
Cold or Cooked

Is best to carry 
In the woods

The balance of flavor
Must also be maintain'd

Too savory 
It will be eaten too quickly

Too wholesome 
You will go malnutritioned

Instant Oatmeal
The perfect trailfood

Light Compact 
Sugary Nutritional

It can be cooked 
Without fire
3hr in a water bottle
Good as cooked

It can warm you in the morn
To wake you to a new day

It can be eaten raw
In intensive bursts
Needed to carry the day

I met a day hiker

He wanted to throw a wrench 
Into the mechanics
That were drive'n him 
Downward

There was no evidence 
Of this on his face
As he offered powwow

Appalachian Heal'n
Had cast its smile
