A pristine reservoir
In manmade cleanliness
Tucked away

Moon bright in the sky

Flames flicker'n at my side
Midnight waters underneath

In a darkened world 
Afloat

The glimmer of Elune
Turn'n black the night
Turn’n black the lake
Turn’n black the forest
Where she brighter shined

In calmness Elune pet
World wide complacency

To blind our eyes
To teach us the virtue
Of Rest

That tho different
We all agree 

To enjoy the present
With rest & tranquility

1 Liter orange juice
Pastries & Treats Galore

As things happen
FrieghtTrain
Ran out of money

I gave him most of that resupply
We did the Ice Cream challenge

He managed to hustle us
A room in the mansion
