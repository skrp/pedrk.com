 IV
Old men narrate their day
Now approaching thirty
Have I lived all of my day?

I am not go’n
To end my tale
Live'n to survive comfortably
Remember'n only

Too burdened & Tied down
To earn a single brag'n rite

Deeds all done
Life's flame drained

Pressure'n the courage
To pull the trigger

To end an odyssey
Finished decades past

---

Rabbit the railcar rider
White-haired
Continue’n his tale till the end

His only companion a puppy
& An associate
Just released from jail

This night having the luck
for a stranger

To offer powwow
In the back alleys
On a Missoula night
.
.
.
It is hard to describe the fright
At see’n the compass turn
Round & Round Erratically

Nights plagued with
Cries, growls & melodies

Nuts tossed down
By large monkeys
 Perched in canopy

Despite this
An evil place

Bent to swallow all life
With life

The Jungle is the best place
To travel barefoot
.

Christina only 16
But big brothers
Know best

A month in Jamaica
Cures all ailments

We would wade to
 Monkey Island

Take in red wisps of sunset
In ocean water
Into a Coconut Bong

Roam'n on an island
All to ourselves
Among large lizards & canopy

Jump'n off the 30ft cliff
To waters
Green, clear & warm

We waded back at dusk
Avoid'n the prick of
 Red Sea Urchins

I commented as we ate
Fresh Jerk Fish
‘ This is delicious
‘ Cept for all the bones

Christina looks up
Face smeared of fish
None left in the foil
' There were bones?

South Texas Moon
Bright for harvest

Above the schoolgrounds
Sleep’n on cardboard

The pack of us
No where else to go
But right here

Swisher lick’d & roll’d
Pass’n the tight blunt
Round that roof

‘ What you think Clay
I look’d for counsel
Have’n never hit

‘ Not a big deal
‘ To do it or not
He assured me

The smokey coal taste
Hit me with immediate revulsion

There was no Cherry Taste
There was no Scooby Doo
.
