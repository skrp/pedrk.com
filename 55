I don’t drink
In other countries

Seems logical
To any sensibility

Threw La Chilanga
A go’n away beer-athon

At our bar
The one out back
Against the jungle

Not many besides
La Banada frequented
The tucked away spot

La Chilanga
Ban’d from the main bar

After knock'n out a girl
In one punch

To even Mickey
An experienced boxer’s amaze
_

The pack returned
In the festive manner
Custom to Mexico

A French sloppily
Trailed behind

Outpaced
In this foreign race

‘ Let’s fuck her
One of our group said

Her swing’n alone
On the hammock

Lost in the
Dark depths of booze

I had to get her up
& Lead her away

From the bamboo huts
Of the locals
& Onto the jungle path

I could only start her off

I couldn’t leave La Chilanga
Too long

A man must always
Protect his own first

That is what
I had to tell myself

As I abandoned the stranger
On a wild path deep of night
.
.
.
Wake’n after
A dark night in
Wallows of rejection

The haze of morn
A marinated mixture
Of defeat & doubt

In the first batch of emails
An acceptance of publication
In a small journal

The first time anyone but me
Looked at my work with
More than contempt

Must be a scam
.
.
.
It is the stranger
That most accurately understands
The heroism of the feat

Bangor Maine
 At a truck stop

FrieghtTrain & I
Looked past homeless


A man found out
By third party
We finished the Thru

He bought us beer
& Me a mtn dew

In the fields
Out ‘n back
_

The last October nights
Of Maine sky

Stars in that clarity
Only possible in such cold

The freeze of dark matter
Of celestial seas
.
