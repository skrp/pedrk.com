In Buenos Aires 
I drop’d an online class
This recalled all financial aide

The Dean declined
My offer to pay half
Of the five figure sum
To continue study’n
On payments

At the University of Utah
I researched an escape path

Up into Canada
Far from here

The Internet 
In its typical fashion
Redirected me

Into an article on 
The Appalachian Trail

Which I had thought
Was in South America

The distraction soon 
Seen as providence

Within the hour
I had a flight to Atlanta
To arrive the next day

 Downtown Atlanta 5am
Crackheads scurry

In final desperate efforts
To hustle up 
Whatever makes their tick purr

Twisted figures
Kept to the shadows
There they jitter spastically

I roamed Atlanta 12hrs
Until I arrived at my CouchSurf host
Jaina from Germany

Cities are the loneliest places
