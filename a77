Scapes

Bright with moss
Dreary brown bark
Slippery boulders

Clouds Low & Heavy
All in grim display

Reminiscent of 
The bogs before Mordor

Fate 
Directed me 

The journey have’n
Longsince past coincidences


These last stages
Before that dark Mountaintop

Ponder’n deep purpose
To all of this

Tho blind to it
Walk’n by obscured faith
V
V
V
Would this all end
In a simple summit

Have’n reach’d
Find’n myself empty

As so many
Of my achievements
Of the past
V
V
v
Only that promise 
Of Wiggles

That Katadyn in Oct
Would form me into
Who I really wanted
To become 
V
V
v
Never have’n seen
A picture of Katahdin 

Late October
Each day in prayer
That Winter 
Stay her dominion
A few more days

Pristine Lakes
Flatlands

Roots web’d above ground
Coil’d to snap an ankle

The dark dangers of 
Murky Woods
V
