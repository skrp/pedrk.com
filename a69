Gorham 2:00am

Cop kick’d me up
Remarkably 
Allow’d me to sleep

Thanks man

Gorham 7:30am

I wake to a kick

 ‘ Oh sorry
‘ I thought you were a trash bag

Said an 
Old smalltown
Country man
With his friend
Before the workday

Huddled out of the rain
Under the small  public pavilion

‘ Wake-n-Bake?
He offer’d with the apology

Grow’n old
I discovered 

Is optional

Impatient from the Storm
I snuck around security
At the base of Mt. Washington

Easily unseen in the storm

The true wrath of the storm
Hit unexpectedly

Again victim 
To arrogance

Wind constantly 50mi+
Gusts much more

Knees shake’n
Not only from cold
But from terror

Realize’n
I wasn’t as badass
As I had believed

Unable to open my pack
To apply the right gear

All in windswept white

Storms elongate distance
On & On

At top
The sirens blare’d

The doors
All lock’d but one

Closed for construction

A worker let met in 
To the mountain train station
Everyone evacuate’n

None of the workers 
Will’n to let me ride down with them

A fellow Texan paid the $45
To get me down

Despite the episode
The train ride was magical
