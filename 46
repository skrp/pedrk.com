 XXXXVI
Fk the world
& Fk you too

You will all know
I made it on my own

After I succeed
When no one else
Believed in me

I don’t care
If its now or never

Deep down inside
Its always been
Predetermined since before

Like the Lion
The King of his sphere
Always has a wild
Tale to be told
.
.
.
Alone
I find the friend
Best suited for me

Of thousands
In infinite variation

He who I really miss
Is me in solitude

Unreigned I prowl my planet
This sphere where I king
In this moment of glory
.
.
.
First night of workweek
Spent in celebration

Japanese Beer
Roasted beef on bone
My wife’s kisses

Mary’s juicy ass
On the oven

Reread’n my writing after all
Have proclaimed my works a Loss

Stubbornly I see only
Beauty & Vividness

Celebration to me
& I the only attendant

Life is most happily spent
In an accustomed enviornment
.
.
.
