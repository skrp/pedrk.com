All I need
One look
One memory 

Then they know
Muthrfkr cast
Apart from the rest

Your reaction
A tired route
Tho to you 
Unique it seem

Off the wall
Blackest of sheep

Lucifer to gods

Try to understand
I'll laugh at your tumble

White razed black
Latin grown Mexican

American at the core
Not that fat phone type

Southern raised
& Never tolerant
When some muthrkfkn
Northerner think they shit

Fk this federation
Rember the cause

Rebel against
Two Faced Tyrants

Minorities proclaimed free
Tho cuffed they ever be
.
.
.
Not for
Womanize'n

For ball'n over
Weak

You down
Cause you want to be

I up 
Thats where 

.
.
.
Approach'n fear
Fk that

I do what I do
But  never what I'm scared to doo

Shit I been against
Many things I done

But shit its proof 
No Fear
After it is done

My first 
High school friend
Anothny
' El Feo
As say his family

He & Benny
Us all watch'n 
Pulp Fiction

My mom bust in
At the start
Of the ass rape'n

My mother see
Aun Snuff
To me 
Know as 'Disney'
The only high schooler
Only allowed to watch 'G'

I could a
Explain'n this an actual movie

Fear fk that
Rather their speculative eyes

At us in 10s
Rise'n from the live'n room floor
Past 10 skip'n school

Never a single female
.

Boxframe Caddillac
Freddie Gibbs

Those seniors you

Offer'n to cruise
Skip'n school to roll

Northside
The side where we
Can only ever be

So if you aint black
Or those visit'n people
Its too aparent

Pull with their
Old grandmother
Holds strong there
.
.
.
Never disrespect me

Texan
Or Narcissism

I'm gonna call you out
To deal undiscolsed bargins

Cause I'm old
Too old

The best day
To come is Today

Call'd out a muthrkfr
In a mexican bar
Defiant against a nest

Sure as shit
I'm call you out
.
.
.
Your bitch
Cum think'n of me

If she ever sees me
Thats just
Who I be

Not handsome
Manly

Cause she know
Imma fk her-
Like my last

I do it
Only to my wife
Like every night
.

Teach'n these
Slovenians

At their bar
They say
' All we got is AKs
' Not good for long distance

I laugh
' All I care about
' Is whats in front 
' Of me up to that railway
( 30 feet)

' Revolvers are best
' Cause you know 
' All you got to do
' Keep on that trigger

Shit those
Are'nt meant for reload'n

' But if you expect
' To use more than 5
' You ain't live'n 
' Much longer anyway
.
.
.
Homeless
To baller

Not have'n excess
But ball'n with
What is given

There the alchemey
' Of Midas hands

Life sweet
In American Saturation

Ball'n
But in reality
Give'n back
To the streets

I know the joy
Of a big tip
& If I can do that
I will

The jackass to most
But value overrides
.
