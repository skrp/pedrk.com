Path 

Independent of Time
Independent of Age

Laid here 
One Last Adventure

In an overrun world

2000mi
Have’n offer’d 
So much

What would I remember
What would I forget

Jewels slip’n off wayside

As if that experience
Meant to be hidden
For the discovery
Of another day

Gratitude settles
For what had brought me here

Up a hill
To the look out

Past the lake
Past the plains

Katahdin
Loomed
 
Lonely & Unuspered
In Might & Strength
_

FrieghtTrain & I

Isolated but intertwined
Together wait’n 
For the clouds

To finally unveil
The face of Katadyn

Fate

The power of the future
To change the past

As is 
The power of light 
Tho warp’d by gravity
must maintain 
The law of the speed of light

In such circumstances
The universe works 
Miracles

This is the underlie’n
Basis of all life
In the universe

Bogs broke into
Beautiful Mountainsides

The gorge in a 
Monstrous rush

Joy of the Journey
Swept me peacefully

So long
Sickness left me 
Destitute of energy
Drain’d of enjoyment

Somber sorrow

This peaceful mountain life
Near the unavoidable end

The bottle of 
Sleeping pills
Only miss’n one

A rapid & definite
Change of character
Since that first day

The future
Is best face’d
With the record
Of past accomplishments
