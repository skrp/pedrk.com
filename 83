 shout out
To my
Masters of Writ
To whom I homage

Dorothea Brande
All stern & inspire'n

William Zinsser
Of cold clarity

Stephen King
Whisper'n dark secrets
Of the living

Walk Whitman
Flow'n the melodies of underground springs

William Blake
A kindred spirit to whom I bow

Mayhap the homogenous belief
Of mankind hold true

That one day we converse
As equals who sacrificed all
To the same god
.
.
.
The Virtue of Narcissism
Ungrasped by the masses

Who could never introvertly
Confirm
Their life as most precious
Confirm
Themselves blessed
By the interested hand of gods

Who need no justification
For received adoration

Prideful gaze
Regardless of mirrors

Confident
To take sure steps forward

Grateful of the past
But mostly
Excited for this new day
.
.
.
Who am I
Which revels in such self
