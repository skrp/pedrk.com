 LXV
Fear pushed me back

Fear of the epic scale
Of the return hitch

The artist of
Yellowknife's City Center Statue

Gave me a lift
Back into Town
  _
 
The next morn
With reawakened courage

I hustled at the gas station
At the border of the city

The woman who owned
Yellowknife Ford Dealership
Attentive to my position

Wiley position'n me
To only check the price
Of a flight to Edmonton

That if ever I need
A Plan B 

With perfect execution
Arlene purchased my ticket

Before I could 
In pride decline
_

Several times I have tried
To find her again

A stranger
Swept away by the current of time

I keep lit
A candle of gratitude
To pay forward in her name
.

.
The Fortune Cookie

Like the cast of dice
Destiny's hand frictionless acts

A consequence ethereal

Nothing given
Nothing taken

But the whisper
Of what is to be

To supersede fact
Faith embodied in form
_

Confucious say
Top of ladder nice place
Can be very lonesome

Quality counts
& You've got it

You are broad-mined
& Socially active

Be cautious
In your financial dealings

You shall attain great wisdom
With each passing year

The star of riches
Is shining on you

Reward yourself to
A much deserved gift

You shall soon make 
A long overdue personal decision

The road to glory will be rocky
But Fulfilling

Your qualities overshadow
Your weaknesses

You will overcome
Difficult times

Next full moon B {

Be tactful 
To not overlook
Your own opportunity

I can eat 
Fortune Cookies
The day long

Next Friday
February 10th

Full Snow Moon
7:33pm

I will be upon
Snowcaked Uintas

The Noob
Fascinated admirer
Lost pleasantly

The Journeyman
Directionless wanderer
Fastidious to the core

The Craftsman
Dedicated to a manner
Enamored at the skill

The Expert
Forge'n deeper
Trailblazer for successors

The Master
Devoid of peers
Lonely & Cold
