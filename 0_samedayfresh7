3rd attempt
To make ridge

Met with quick failure

You only ever
Need to suceed once

This time
Blunted Blazed & Ridgeside

They asked
Of my yoga

We preformed
Sacrament

Beef Jerky
No water
Is never fun

Then the chug
Moutain Dew
In one hit

Sunrise pose
Inhale blunt
Rise exhale smoke

Blaine
The choo choo train
Let smoke out
Only in small percentages
Inhale'n precentages of fresh
Hypervent out

Among blaze
We commited ritual

Solitary Ridgeside
Elune enshrouded
Late no light

All were blessed
With the cough
.
.
.
Lost deep
In the foggyness
Of a lost state

Soul in
Perpetual Instability

Social smog of failure
Too poptent not to be fact

What strikes me hot
Above any understand'n

To others 
Neutral Lukewarm
Spew from thy mouth
Away lunatic

But words
Keep flow'n

As long as my biches love me
I could give me a fk bout no hater

Im on that good kush
Imma ball to the day I fall
.
.
.
31 Aint so bad
Fair I see it shine
On everyone

Death I begin to fear
Greater with everyday

Life in that stillness
Caught of heart
As if all the universe
Needs a breather
For what bout to hit you

La Santa Muerte
Loves the surprised

She will catch you
& Your time slowed demise
Will be cherised
.
.
.
Fk Tomorrow
Natural path

If todays effects
Tomorrow so greatly

What greater proof
Do you need
To still do it

Sleep
I'm always an asshole anyway
.
.
.
My birthdays
Spent alone

Surprise Birthday
A wish itself

Alone on some
Forgien ground

But not that time
On that suicide
Ride down the mountain

I made it to Helena

A girl & friends
Greeted me a stranger
At a bar to celebrate my birthday
By word alone
But even such is powerful

Surprise 
You aren't alone on your birthday

Tho it the expected outcome
Never been Montana way
.
.
.
'The quickest way
'Is not the straight path
'Of mathematics
'Karate

'Tai Chi
'To already be there
A mass of sticky hands

Grandmaster Yang Jwing Ming
( the very person )
( that hailed me )
( Luke Skywalker of Chi )

He might not have
Believed it himself

I mean to make it
Prophecy
.
.
.
'Dont feed
'Gremlins past midnight

Dont get
Richie blunted up

Ridgeside
Where I can be me

The lunatic
Provisions
Of the Appalchian Trail

The mirror being
Of me I'm see'n

Maniacs ride hard
Hold on tight
.
.
.
Breathless moment
When a song
Is understood

Mayhap bypassed
Plenty before

Freddie Gibbs
'Just Tryin' Ta Make it

Birthed in me resolve
That succeed to Sneznik
A journey
That took many days

Against them locals
Aun to sneer
But I suceeded

Sneer me
I just smirk back

You
As the countless past

No where to find
To dance all up on
Mistaken faithless fks
.
.
.
Best Sony Headphones
Over the ear

Mayas well be speakers

Up on them streets
All in local cryptic

Bitches on the street
Gonna hear some
'Bussdown
Gibbs

To drive them
Interactionless

I front up 
In your town

You only can wish
What I'd bring on you

'Im the man
In your city
.
.
.
Old women
Only need one look

To be told
To very depths

What I be bout

That unicorn
Only ever in tales
Never real to fk you

Then I come in
Roland of Gilead

It ends up being
My decision

Boxer Mickey
'Women make you weak

I dont allow you to ask
It is the regret of denial
That will haunt you everlasting
For have'n not taken
What had been demanded of life
.
.
.
Drama
Excrement of Society

My love is honest
Regardless of my love

That to me
Is my only definition
.
