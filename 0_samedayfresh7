3rd attempt
To make ridge

Met with quick failure

You only ever
Need to suceed once

This time
Blunted Blazed & Ridgeside

They asked
Of my yoga

We preformed
Sacrament

Beef Jerky
No water
Is never fun

Then the chug
Moutain Dew
In one hit

Sunrise pose
Inhale blunt
Rise exhale smoke

Blaine
The choo choo train
Let smoke out
Only in small percentages
Inhale'n precentages of fresh
Hypervent out

Among blaze
We commited ritual

Solitary Ridgeside
Elune enshrouded
Late no light

All were blessed
With the cough
.
.
.
Lost deep
In the foggyness
Of a lost state

Soul in
Perpetual Instability

Social smog of failure
Too poptent not to be fact

What strikes me hot
Above any understand'n

To others 
Neutral Lukewarm
Spew from thy mouth
Away lunatic

But words
Keep flow'n

As long as my biches love me
I could give me a fk bout no hater

Im on that good kush
Imma ball to the day I fall
.
.
.
31 Aint so bad
Fair I see it shine
On everyone

Death I begin to fear
Greater with everyday

Life in that stillness
Caught of heart
As if all the universe
Needs a breather
For what bout to hit you

La Santa Muerte
Loves the surprised

She will catch you
& Your time slowed demise
Will be cherised
