5pm on a weekday
My first strip club experience

Blinded by darkness
We entered into the corridor

A crack-whore immediately approached us

‘ Hey handsome
She jeers at Wayne
‘ I need a real man
‘ To get me off
She says look'n at me

Bashed by a crack-whore
This was get’n interesting

‘ I'm looking for Kristi
Wayne tells her
‘ She is working tonight
‘ Right? 

‘ Oh she just left
The whore said smartly

Signal'n thru some 
pre-planned method

Likely common
In this business

Wayne left me there
To rage in the restroom

His carefully crafted scheme
Thwarted
By a half-concious whore

She turned to me
‘ No hard feelings, Right?

‘ This is just between us
‘ Couchsurfers

Wayne informs me 
On the ride home

Their home was classy

I suffered the
Social sit down with his wife

I avoided them
As much as possible

Middle-Class
Behind-the-scenes
Left me internally upset
