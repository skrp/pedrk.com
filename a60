Christina had hip pain
From constant travel

At a riverside grove
100yr Earlier been a town

Only one trace of it left

At that town’s graveyard
We slept

Deep in the woods
Remains below me

Are souls still
Bound to this place?

Andrew Allen
Do you rest among us

Or deep in the mine
In which you were killed?

Mayhap we call you
Out of those depths
To what few remains 

A peaceful place
Of woods held sacred
By those who buried 
You at 30

Rain is cold

Only if 
You stop from hike’n

Twigs 
Perferrably Pine

Gather’d under large
Expanses of branches

Sorted
Start’n from needlelike

This is the craft
To create a seed for flames

Dangerously
Low on snacks

We hitch’d
On a solitary forest road

A vehicle pass’n
Lurched to a break

To race backwards at us
Put me on the alert

But his quirkiness
Like ours
Drew from kindness

The resupply a 
20min drive

He told me to leave my pack with him
I could trust him

The hand that aid’d
Ask’d trust in return

Unquestionably
An uneven trade

Implied Contracts
Are always real
muthrfkrs

Miraculously the man
Was true to his word
_

On the long drive back 
Deep in the woods
 
He stop’n to use the restroom
Found himself
Caught in that same trap

‘ I guess you trusted me
‘ So I got to trust you

The man left the car run’n
As he left into the wooded restroom

Miraculously the man
Had a car afterwards
