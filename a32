Up the mountain 8:30pm
Black Monstrous Clouds
Invaded across the sky

As if on the wings of Boreas
With the power of gods
It brought rainless blasts

Rip'n tree from root
Fell'n them in torrents

A day hiker
Head'n Down & Out

In madness of terror
While descend’n around 
A fallen tree 
Turn’d to follow me 
Into the woods

I eventually had to stop
& Assure the man that

He needed to go the other direction
To his car 
Away from this wilderness

He reluctantly complied
_

Not 30 yards 
Between felled trees

Soon I was reduced
To crawl'n on my 
Hand's & knees
Search'n for path 

All pitch’d black
The earth itself rattle’n
A madness worthy of legend

Despite the dark
I did not get lost
Use'n no light

Maybe that storm shook me
Also to depths of madness

I saw a beast perch'd
The glitter of his eyes
Not that of deer

It perch'd as sure as a 
Mountain Lion
It's form that distinct shape

I slowly made my way by
Give’n it wide berth

Its attention on me
Of bewilderment that
I summit’d despite the storm
V
V
V
At the shelter
Thankful for protection
I met FrieghtTrain

I slept tuck'd up
Avoid'n the prick of the hornet's
Whose nest 2ft above my head
