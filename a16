At every resupply
It is because

At the lowest gap in the range
A road can run thru

Make’n a quick entry to resupply
But the climb out
When you are overstuffed
Is a real muthrfkr

The past days had been
Many of those gaps

Descend’n down
‘ As Knob
I felt the pain

I could only crawl
Step by step
The next miles 
To the water source
v

It was a measly water source
But I managed to do all my wash’n

A skill I perfected
2yrs In Mexico

The Dark Tower
A needed repose
From non-fictional adventure

Sleeping pills 
At the ready

Ankle massaged
Night slowly drap'n
