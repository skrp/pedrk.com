6mi to the
Nantahala Outdoor Center

Walk’n from a hot meal
The Hiker Burger

Someone called out
‘ You hike’n the trail?

Then threw me a 
Mountain Dew

I don’t know 
If it was that can
Or the new Leki trek’n poles

Past 6pm
Bathsalts & DHB
Not pressed for time

I decided I could not linger
Alone I continued

Up that climb North
All dark woods & storm
Thunder & Tree Crash

Storm in definite torrent

Dark forests
Glazed by water
In nightly glows

Up those
Twisted & Mangled Paths
Only need’n to be 
Narrow enough for one

A majestic sky invoked 
Super Natural Powers
Upon this ancient mountain top

Have’n long since
Come into intimate
Cohabitiation with
The Mound & Vegitation

Pop’n open its eyes
As Thunder Struck Lightn’n

Woods vocalize’n wind
Into hallow’d chants

In prophecies await’n
Their times return

At NOC outfitter 
I purchased my first
Water treatment

Aquamira
A product I swear by

The tick of the minute
Meant cash out of my pocket

Most I met
Tried to prepare me for failure

But like everything
I met it in the stubbornness 
Of ignorance

A childhood trait

Definite goal 
In mind

Pack under
20lbs base weight
_

There was no bridge
To return to my past

All laid in waste

A new future must be forged
If there ever was to be one

Till I reach tomorrow
& Write down what all happened

Whether it be about 
The brilliance
Of color off a Box Turtle shell
Slowly make’n his way 
Down the mountain

Or the greasy slyness
That seeps off the 
Black scales
Of a nested snake
In the hollow 
Of a tree trunk
V

Of all things
I was happiest
I ditched 
My cotton socks
For wool socks
At that outfitter
