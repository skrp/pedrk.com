Past 3:30am 
When I caught up
To the Bathsalt Gang

8am 
We picked up camp & moved
Miserable but enjoy'n company
I trailed sleepily behind Hambre

After 3mi we arrived 
At a dead end

A cemetery buried 
Deep in the woods

It's ancient markers worn illegible by time
In deep wilderness

Awake in the fright of being lost

We found our way back
Hambre also exhausted
Had follow’d Orange blazes

Back at the trail 
I decided to go solo

They kept a 25mi pace

These scapes deserved calm appreciation
So I sat on a boulder
& Blazed up
V
V
V
To blaze up
Is not a simple task

When travel’n know’n
Not to carry much

An apple
A pen & foil

Many things 
I’ve craft’d for smoke

Police & I
Naturally gravitate
