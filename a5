I left their home
& A thank-you note

To continue my journey

Still a far distance
From the Appalachian Trailhead

This was my first time 
Hitchike'n in the States

Most things in life
Can be accomplished
Just by try’n
_

I helped a guy roll his motorcycle
Up to the gas station

Obviously distraught
When he admited
‘ I don’t have any money
‘ To give you

Most people my entire life
Have assumed me a homeless
Or a hooker

40min later a woman
In a large red truck 
Pulled aside

‘ You don't look dangerous
She said out the window
As she stop’d

Her downs-syndrome daughter disagreed
She kept call'n me
‘ Bad man

In her day she had hitch'd
These where her rules:

1 - Never get into a car with more than one person
2 - Never wear a seat belt
3 - Keep the door unlocked

She also told me 
To ditch my unrefrigerated balone
If I ate it I would be poisoned

Our paths overlaid
For the first half

I thanked her 
Then went on my way

Ben picked me up 
On his way to the ranch

He decided to take me 
All the way to the trailhead
Amicola

I'd never heard of Amicola
But he was sure
& Didn't pay attention to my suspicion

Maybe it was the rain 
That convinced him
To be the only one 
After hours 
To pull up aside

But some people
Will pick you up
Regardless

I mostly 
Meet strangers

The bond of a strangers
Has only ever been of
Unbroken trust
