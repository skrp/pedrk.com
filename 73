A deep-seated prime

In a universe
Full of factorials
Only relative points
Supported & Sustain'n
_

Myself only a comet
Set in course
To ride till die

Of thousands
In infinite variation
I pass
_

My wife
A celestial prime

Enfold'n me
In gravitational pulls

Her alone 
Able to enchant
Me to orbit

Flares & Auroras

A singular Cartesian
In planes of monotony

Her light worshiped
In the local faith of remote lands 
Until eclipsed to infinities

Wonders & Impossibilities
To fill tomes of poetry

A creation of gods
To be a Constant
To guide the faithful
_

Myself  a comet
Elevated to roles 

As the Elune
Her moon

To build her
To greater beauties

Calm'n the turbid waters
Set'n order to tides

Together
Each adorne the other
_

Myself only a comet
But even such
Has needful purpose

A light 
Rapid Small & Enamorate'n

A glimmer of hope
If the night is right

On clear rural scapes
To a stranger look'n up

Envoke'n
Prophecies & Foretell'n

The brief enchantment
To proofs
Of greater planes

Answer of prayers
By the ethereal hand of Fate

Invoked upon
Rangers of celestial seas

A humble roid
Only aspire'n
To be
As molded
Lonely Cold & Overlooked

Only a light
To those laid low

Painted into darkness
By ashes of misfortune

I lead to doors
Of divergent trajectories

There to search
Promised Lands

Thru whispers
Their forefathers
Pass thru me
