Gravity  & Time
Intricately weaved

Physical perspective 
In tune with the two

Perspective(Physical) = Time(Gravity)

My fat black cat
Has a physical perspective
Much quicker than my own

This  law is her
Justification
To look at me
As if I am stupid
_

I woke
From nyquil tranquility

The night prior
Full of horror

As if its state
Kept me there

Infinitely longer
A quantum world

& It

Bearing no mass
Void of Physical Perspective

An experience
At times too great

As if 
The blackness of sleep
A mercy to most

We all joined
At Quantum Junctions
_

3Chop came over
An hour later

Used her membership
To get my ticket out

Over the Oceans
To Eastern Europe

Fascism
Doesn't head in politicians
It heads
In its internal force

FBI
Now with fantastic
Fascist Powers

Their cyber net
Cast over all

I reach to
Empower Privacy
.
.
.
En route
To El Yunque

At a bar

Across the Police Station
Where the taxi left me

I needed a lighter

A drunk guy
Turned to me

' You are going
' To the jungle

' Just to check it out
I replied

He responded
'As soon as you asked
' For a lighter I knew
' I work there
' You can't stay there
' Over night its illegal

I was annoyed
The taxi driver
Just harang'd me about that
_

A couple hours pass
Late up the jungle road

Late of night
Many fears remembered

Unpassable marshes

Mud in that charateristic
Rich Ocre Murk

Night still & bright

A white car
Pulled up honk'n

Oh shit
The Rangers

It was the guy
From the bar

' Want a ride

He & his wife
Drove me the 10 miles up

Take'n 20 miles out of his way
To drop me off

Strangers
Always surprise me
