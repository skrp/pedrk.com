I swear with exhausted soul
I will only go
To the first bushes

Just to kiss Mary
Then head back to archive

After the joint is rolled
I open the door

Amerith perks up expectantly
From the other side

He came to answer
Mary's smell

No creature
Can smile like dogs

He knows
Tonight will be epic

His misunderstand'n
His fault

After the joint is smoked
I find myself discover'n

A new trail
A better trail

One year by 5mi of mountain
& I have something new
To discover each weekend

The frosted thickets
Pink in the moonlight
Like frozen strawberry milk

But this place is not sweet
Do not reveal yourself

The woods are never empty
Do not disturb the deer
Do not attract the lion
.
.
.
Karma hits like a bitch
From behind with a brick

You just got to take it
Cause that's how women work
.

A few months ago
I was kicked out of the jungle
By a tribesman with a machete
& Another with a rifle

Can I keep risk'n life
In the pursuit of adventure?
Or do I settle hustle'n
In one place?

Get fat while the get'n is good
I guess

God knows
Adventure'n only feeds you enough
To keep on go'n
.
.
.
 My weapons are of
The Elite Grade

This machete built
Like a cleaver

Distinctly indigenous in structure
The heft of it
Would serve a butcher

Out in the Jungle
That blade served me well

Burst'n into the open
No longer lost & look'n back

Into that deep cylinder
2ft above the ground

Carved by the machete
My exodus like a drill

 Envy would grip
The tribesmen

When they tested
Its decisive cuts
.
.
.
Most memories are
Of dramatic excitements

But now in my age
I wish to cherish

The savor of new mountainsides
Or the small trickles
Of pure springs

Mother Nature’s beauty
Is too emense to describe
I can only take away impressions
.
.
.
Green Bull

The shadow of
Relentlessness

This Friday
As many past

Up since morn
Work the day
Home to tinker

Blazed Up & Coffee brew’d

See’n the next sun
Till it well risen
.
.
