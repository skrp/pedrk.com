 XXXXIV
Rather the virtual god
Than he who pretends to
Understand physical reality

We master
Where we are
Best suited to master

Swim'n thru seas of information

Hack'n unix in mine own image

Archive'n the intelligence of a era
_

An unprecedented point
In history

An era when
Aun a lone stoner hacker

Can nurture
A seed

To rebirth what will
One day be lost
.
.
.
A mane to a man
Is a testament
To his edge

Out in the wild
Any puffery
Can put him past
A dangerous path
_

Nightime hang’n in
Newfoundland bogs

Alone as before
Wild as ever

Something terribly wrong
With my position
In this world

At the end
Of this conquest

Anxiety a sith force
Fuel'n my adventures
My entire life

Now turn'n its face
Against what it forged

It tore at my soul
In a canker of the heart

Take'n the form of Homesickness
Bore'n in dramatic penetrations
_

Carved now
A man into his 30s

Not the wild boy
Of Pan Legend

Someone stand’n firm
With courage to settle

In ritual of this rebirth
My wild unkempt beard
Shed

Upon a new world
With exposed chin

I build a homestead
& Learn to cultivate
Its soil
.
.
.
 Fanatics
Suit me best

The All-In
When presented against
The obvious

The spirit of the cultist
Sip'n koolaid en masse
_

Those of low imaginagtion
Scoff to pity such fate

But what sweet juice
Is burst from the fruit
Of believe’n in fate
.
.
