The confessions of Tolstoy

Confirm write’n
Is a tree sprung

From singular pools
Of singularity

Fed from underground springs 
Of narcissism

Think’n is spectacular
Tho not work

Men yearn for
The sweat of the day
_

Tolstoy's self-drunkenness
Is that of my fat black cat

Complain’n as it licks up
Every bit of what it
In no honesty earned

The life of a true poet
That of poverty

Regardless of how spectacular

Any abundance to such poet
Due to the failures of culture
Which foolishly squanders
Where it is needed the least
_

Tolstoy bathed in honey
As he hung on root
Have’n two mice as servants

Tho there a terrify’n Dragon
At the bottom of the well

He was most terrified
At have’n to get out his bath
_

The cup of obscurity
Bites with a bitterness

That the experienced
Sips as a welcome soothe

Veener of sweetness
Craved in youth
Eroded to its sour base

These works
Created & matured

Fallen wayside
Underneath trash & waste

To the Reaper the reward
If any to be had

My daily meat
The freely abundance
Of pass’n tribulation
