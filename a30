Hikers use logs
Left in shelters
To stay in touch

I had only ever traveled with
DHB & Bathsalts
Separated since NOC

I didn't find much use for logs
Until the day I was run'n out of water

One log foretold of more drought ahead

I spent 2 hours boil'n water
Out in a dry grove

Water drawn from a puddle
Posted a warn'n of Parasites

The microscopic 
Were not microscopic
Red & squirm’n 

2mi later
I found a perfectly clear water source

I decided to stay away from logs

Shout out to Marion
Tho large
Kind to the hikers

Care not driven by greed
Of what little hikers have

They host a shuttle
For hiker's to enter town

The driver offered her Applesauce

Their library staff are
Friendly & Considerate

Thanks for the cokes
Left on US 52

Only the most devout
Have faith in hikers
Late as now on the trail

True Brit offered shelter
At his dojo nearby

The place supported most hikers
Pass'n thru

Unaccustomed to the delight
Of other hikers

I became terribly drunk

Beware the bite of
Four Lokos

Mary's calm haze settles
Even a those hang-overs

I enjoyed my first zero

At Symmns Gap
Mile 641

In the haze
Of the last of my weed

High up
Its lonely tree

Solemn of mind
Know’n my path
Much farther than

The distant & abstract scapes
Paint’d in broad colors
Ocre Steel & Kush

Anything Goes Burrito

Boil'd Carrots & Onion
Instant Potato
Roasted Pepperoni
Melted Extra Sharp Cheddar
On a Tortilla
Cooked over embers

I had developed an entire
Collection of pack recipes

Genius spiced my meals

People center around the 
Main course

I center on what bonds
The elements together
