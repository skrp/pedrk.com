I rose like I had everyday since
Gather'n wood for the breakfast fire

I also mistakenly 
Gathered a snake

The copperhead sleepy still

I kicked Christina awake
Threw her machete at her
Then commanded her to kill it

The snake woke real fast 
As Christina missed

They fought thru the bramble

The copperhead strike'n
Christina miss'n

Despite the undergrowth
Christina kept her focus

The snake dove
 Into a leap'n strike

The machete 
SHINK 
Split the air

The open-mouthed head 
Severed from its body

Spin’n out into the distance

3Chop held the severed body with one hand
With the other 
Peeled down the copperhead's skin

3Chop tore out the guts
Washed the twitch'n corpse in the river
Built a fire
Roast'd the unseasoned meat 
& Ate

3Chop became addicted
To a concoction I crafted

Cappuccino o Wheat

Cream of Wheat
Cooked in cappuccino mix

This powered her healthily thru

To keep on go’n
At a decent pace
