 XXVI
I researched pathways on Google Maps
Of one Hong Kong Island

Nighttime on the pathway
I saw lights
Swift & Search'n
 Miles off
At the other end
Of this ocean cove
I assumed it a Lighthouse

At the other end
Of the ocean cove
I found no lighthouse

Only a sign in
Cantonese & English
But I care naught for adversements

Up the only path
Up the hill to a village
Which cultivated the slopes
Of this Mountain Ravine

There near the summit
Lay a house
Large Wooden & Old

Odd to see a non-vacant house
Look Dead & Still

Farm paths led different places
I stayed on the path
That led to the mountain pass

The search’n lights I'd seen
From the other end
Of the ocean cove
Were now focused
On something at the mountain pass
The lights became many

The action of the beams disturbed me
By the nature of its frantic movements
To the extent I decided to retreat

Failed & deeply distraught
I knew this the only path

I headed back
There repass'n the sign
I stopped to read it

 ‘ If you cross this border
‘ You trespass
‘ Into a private village
‘ We will assume you are a thief
‘ And treat you accordingly

DefCon 23
Dropped off in Las Vegas
Alone with no plan at night

Under 20 minutes
I sat hold'n a
Black dealer’s
Gold chain

Collateral
 As he went
To get my weed
_

Las Vegas lights are trippy
When you are high

Smoke'n a joint
You roll'd out back

The lights to my back
Turned out to be
Not the cops

But that fright had startled me
My smartphone
Fell & shattered

Destroy'n any way to contact
Those who had my room

From Wed morning at 7am
Till Saturday afternoon at 3pm
 I went without sleep
_

Las Vegas

The only city
Where the night is life

& The day
Only a drunken stumble home
.
.
.
My weapons
Are of the Elite Grade

None more fine in the grade
Of practicality
& Brotherly protection

1100mi into the Appalachians
Christina would join me

For one month
Of 400mi of mountain

Downtown Harrisberg Penn
At a military surplus

As an Eagle Scout
It is a surprise
To bled when testing a blade

I decided to return
To purchase what kiss'd me

Tho there was no money to spare
Her lipstick served
Too strong a memory

The Spax SP-18
Cost a dear $50
.
.
.
A binary god
Shape’n reality

Hack’n unix
After mine own likeness

Faith to preserve
Intelligence digitally
.
.
.
Aged
Fermented in Failure

These songs resonate from
A salted soul

Have'n only succeeded
By the statistical need

For all functions
To have outliers

Turn'n to the written word
To salvage the debris

Of visions strewn asunder
Where once epic schemes bloomed

In all the glory
Of imaginations
_

Tho pained evermore
Still peace reins

Where there are no
Unanswered questions
.
.
.
Live'n Fast
To Die Young
Since Childhood

13 & Down those bayside slopes
Body cruch’d to the longboard

Luck the only guardian
To keep a car
From intercept’n at bottom
.

Friday Night
Sanctified of Mary

Coffee run'n its course

Consoles Alt'd
Scroll'n by

Man pages print'n & mark'd
To issue way

When the fabric of mind
Beg's Mercy & Repose

But repose it will not have
For that is the secret
To this Sanctification

Till Stress
Pressure'n Full-Throttle

Only fertile offer'n
Mary savors sweetly

Upon such grounds
Great Gifts Bestow’d

Purified by insight
On extra-natural planes

Upon that Transcendental
To Quest for questions
.
