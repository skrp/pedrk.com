May 20th
The morn sang

Beautiful & Bright
Lush & Vibrant

A good mood was inescapable

The 6mi to the 
Summit of Springer
Full of heal’n

I had used the paper map for firestarter
The most worn paths were the ones I chose

On Springer 
I began build’n a fire

A couple approached me
With 2 Powerbars

I turned them down
‘ I don’t need Powerbars 
‘ I can get this started
But they insisted

45min later
I was eat’n Powerbars

In Texas 
A fire past a certain point
Is a healthy heart

Not so much so here
I been past that point
Numerous times

Two old men around a fire
Allowed me to boil eggs

I boiled the dozen
Future fire unlikely

One old man 
Had hiked the trail
Twenty years ago to the day

An adventure he started 
The day after he retired

The first thru hiker
I met

His advice
Ditch all the pots
Cook from a cup
& Only sleep in shelters
