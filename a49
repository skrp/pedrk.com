Faith
I studied many years

Ancient monk writ
To new day philosophy

Tho the concept
Always eluded me

Faith I did find
After long darkened toil

Everything On The Line
Keep’n Steady & One Way

Known’n the path to fail
Tho 
Known’n this the only path
Worth take’n

Wholesome Bittersweet Peace
Have’n Longsuffer’d
A dreary yet kindred road

Prayhap 
It end in Miracle
Find’n not Failure
But the Mountaintop
So long Sought
V

V
Since Springer
Told I was fated to fail

People drew me 
Into argument
That I would not have
The Thru

Know’n more than me 
Which I agreed
_

Harpers Ferry 
The place to
To Flip to Katahdyn
& Hike down

But that is a path
I’d take 
Under no circumstance

Harper's Ferry
A place out of Legend

Power & Strength 
Of ancient days

Echoed glory 
From a source far away

What great fortune
To haunt such streets
