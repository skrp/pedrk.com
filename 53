Depression
Weigh’n heavy

Prosaic masterpieces
Overlooked by all

Myself
The only admirer

How long
Can one glide upon
The faith of oneself?
_

Mary’s smile
Upon me

An approval
Transcendental

Be what may
This what I always wanted

Hacker Adventurer Poet

Get’n by
Hustle after hustle

The cloak of change
Shadows at the end
Of every day

A blank white plane
Shine’n hope in peripherals

As it looms with the brightness
Of each noon day

Now is good
But tomorrow
Is something new
.
.
.
To see into a shell
& Hear the C

To know the logistics
Of File Systems

To recreate that system
After ones own likeness

hacker adventurer poet

Combine’n polar opposites
Freedom & Security

A write-only ZFS implementation
Of mass archival data

To allow for remembrance
Of former glory
& A history of great decay
.
.
.
A child
Ever repress’n great energy

Always alone on streets
Or in a nook with a book

End’n up as me
Hacker Adventurer Poet

Destiny carved my path
To ends I have always seen

Plenty hadn’t gone as worked out
More often that naught for me

Yet the karma of life
Always puts me right

As I was always
Meant to be
.
.
.
Joy unmatched
Is the victor’s call

Triumphant shout
A ring of brass trumpets

Day after day
Month after month

For one end to which
One had so long sought

Now in exclamations
Of life’s reaction

Pure that energy
To metamorphise anew

To new positions
Besought in certain places
.
