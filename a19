Stand'n Indian Mtn
Mystical in late May

Float'n on
Nike Frees

Up elevation enshrouded
By the intimate 
Fog of clouds

Brilliant colors
Lit by pierce'n sunbeams

Spring in all its 
Provocative aromas

Enormous dark grey boulders
Bound together the scenery

Bathsalts & I read together 
At a waterfall

I stayed a bit longer

Come'n thru the gap
I discovered 
Some of those Memorial Day brats
Threw away the majority of

Two 24-pack of soda
& Reeses candy

There was a bag for trash
Oddly apart from the discarded sodas

Very conveniently placed 
Near the Reeses 
To discard the wrappers

Life is sometimes odd like that

I didn't know if
DHB & Bathsalts
Found this repository

So I hauled up
As many as I could

This wasn't 
Goâ€™n to the trash
