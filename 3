I worked fire into a blaze
 To keep from freeze’n
Surrounded by the voices of

Cascades Falls  
Brooks Streams

These all associated
With the hub that was

This remote glacial pond
In The Bob Marshall Wilderness

The freeze of the moon
Overpowered the flame's heart

Again & Again
The bonfire wrought to naught

Awaken'n me to
Cold consciousness & duty

In slumber’n prayer
For a new day
.
.
.
With blacks
Rolling by
Bouncing beats
Staring all down

Listen up
Here we are
Whats go’n on

On the South Side
This is the street
Fk the police
.
.
.
The fathers
Hunted & Killed
To accommodate residentials

Now their adolescent offspring
Play aimless in the woods
With naught example to follow

One play'd
Grab'n at a moth
To the effect
He dance'd on a rock

An adolescent
Took care of a youngling
No mama there
To protect nor guide

I have seen all three
The mama bear
The too-old-to-be-there bear
& The cub

In destroy'n the aggression
That the sunrise be
A new bond'n relation
Between the master
& The mammal

Some people
You just remember

4:20am on a Cancun bus
With the magician in-transit
To his house

I met some drunks

The next day
Run’n around the city streets
With La Chilanga

I hear 'Tejano!'
It was that drunk guy
From the bus

I remember him
