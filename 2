I
I often find myself lost deep in pathless bramble
On moonless nights up Slate Canyon

On returning
Unsuccessfully I track my path home

Alone
I look upon the unfamiliar mountainside

At the edge of a broad rock-slide
Or on the boundary of a pitched rock-face

Though there is no moon
I know there is no path

My lost predicament is neither the advance'n
Nor the retreat'n of my journey

It lies in a void of retreat'n yet advance'n
Independent of Time
I react with the universe authentically

Untainted by the idea of answers
Because there is no Future
Without a past
There was never a Question

A sort of somberness sets over me
In this warped & complicated condition

I felt that today
When I was told a certain girl got married
.
.
