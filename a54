The Quantum Hack
Of Quantum Roads

Meccas are places
Parallel personalities likely visit

Connections entangle despite dimension
To other kindred beings

Those meetings here
Have a way
Of convex'n back upon themselves

In pivotal moments
Unite'n to fulfill a Destiny

My Appalachian Trail 
An experience of 
Total Discovery

I did not know 
Any of the places 
I was to go

Every step somewhere
I never heard of

No vista I learnt of

On the long lonely path
At times 
All is just too much

Drugs are the friend
In your pack
That can carry you

Lift’n you above the 
Worries & Actualities

Present’n the Present
As a Present

To be cherished
Despite All Else

Shit’n in the woods
Is something everyone
Can appreciate after habit

Pass as need settles
The mound of it
Your digestive log

Leave your pack
Towards which direction
You need to go

Exhaustion works
In mysterious way

Incorporate what you miss
Comfort is everything

Never let anyone unfamiliar
Know where you will sleep

Only hitch with someone
Who is already headed 
Past where you are go’n

Marathoners are idiots
Ignore them

Mace is the best defense
For its weight
Skunks swear by it

Buy two & test one

Fire is a craft
Always extend your ability

Only take half days
In towns

To save momemntum & budget

Have a store of backup food
Extremely light
