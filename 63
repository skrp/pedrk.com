All Magicians
Need of their artifact

dagger
wand
staff

Such things
Come when due

Lost on snowcaked slopes

Under a rest’n tree
My hand fell upon
A stone dagger

Ancient hilt
Fit my grasp perfectly

Shrunk after these years

Finally found
My favorite beers
Japanese on Draft

Ate Naruto’s Favorite
Ichuraku Ramen from-scratch

Providence is in the details

Lies we tell our youth

I’m just as young
But much more able
