The night had been 
Full of heal'n
As magic moments happen

My ankle was fine
I crossed over into 
North Carolina
In the early morn

My first state boundary
Simply a carve'n

On 6in wood

Lush with clear
Mountain springs

Visions of pure greens
Dew that uplifted all in a Glitter

Mossy rocks proved 
Dominion of life over all

A splendid dip
After potatoe/cheese Surprise
Reeses for Desert

Springs

Small streams of water
Come'n directly from the Mountainside

Creeks 

Collections of Springs
Larger & Flow'n

With fish that nibble on you
As you soak

Rivers 

Collections of Creeks
Massive & unfortunate
To drink from

Always fun
To jump into
