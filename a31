June 29th
Hot & Desperate

Shred’d the sleeves
From my shirt
The first hour

In the next hour
I shave'd 
My considerable growth

By dull blade
In a small puddle
Fed by slow trickles

Heat unbearable
No cover of shade
_

Thank you 
Special K
You are an angel

To be surprised after a
Stubbornly steep climb

With cold drink
& Savory treats

Down a road
Typical of classic rural Virgina

I knocked upon 
The first house

An elderly lady
Lent me her phone
Tho terrified of my presence
_

I’d met some people
Who like others
Took pictures of me
As I fed upon their treats

In the manner of one
Who is grateful
To photograph wild beasts

Always driven to feed
To be sure it is
Preoccupied 

They enthusiastically 
Offered to host me 
When I got to this point
Tho now they bailed
_

The elderly woman
Told me of a pavilion
Where I could stay
A bad storm was ahead
She warned

I assured her
A storm is no challenge

When the storm hit
Trees fell like rain

The crash
A boom above thunder

Around one large felled tree 
A Day Hiker came round

In his hysteria
He began to follow me

Back round
Up the mountain

I eventually
Had to stop & tell him

‘ Turn around
‘ You go'n the wrong way

His car was that way
His home in that direction
_

Reduced to crawl'n
As dark was upon me

The Clash & Bash
Of tree fall

Palpable
Tremors from the trees

Past the ridge
Upon a perch of rock

An odd beast crouch’d

Not a deer
Not only by form
But also by the way 
The eyes caught light

Focused upon me
Amazed I summit’d 
Despite the storm

Its perched position
Permit’n lengthy
Consideration of me
