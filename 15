There are many calls
Songs to bring on the night

Fits of Gossip
& Of Communication

Insects Birds Mammals Reptiles
The jungle hosts many

But there is one cry
Best over the rest

The Spanish Mating Call

How could the wild ignore
The commotion of her fuck

Not see the bamboo hut
Standing Tall & Solitary
Shudder in prolonged ecstasy

Resonate’n from primal loins

Sacred
Irresistible

Those calls of !Que Rico!
From hot-blood

All creatures fall silent
In respect & curiosity

A good-bye to all the men
That were her friends

Leave’n all but one
Want’n with need

Shameless & Proud
Full-bodied
Smooth of pitch
Drawn in longing

For all to hear
But one to answer
.

Google Maps pathed me
To this northern town

North beyond Edmonton
It caters as a crossroads

For the only 2 highways
Continue’n North

An elderly Canadian couple hosted a garage sale
I approached them with an offer
I hope not refused

Twenty American
To lodge my motorcycle on their property

That I should continue on
To the isolated North
By hitchhike

They wouldn't let me leave
Without a full stomach

A dinner of
Friends, family, posterity

A classic canadian meal
Is always complemented
By warm'n a stranger
.

My lil sis Chistina
Only really ever
Says dumb things

Lose'n sense of height
Degrade'n black people
In a Jamaican jungle
Near a black man with a machete

Or in Washington DC
Insist'n a local
The National Monument was the Pentagon

Or in front of Walmart exclaim'n
' Oh shit its the Cops!
5ft from the cops
.
.
.
Diahreea
Deadly flush of the bowels

Christmas Eve
I nearly died

Ulcers Fever
Salmonila & Pnemonia

Find’n the doctor in the church

Take’n her from her guests
Enjoy’n las fiesta

With Her & my companion
She tells me I need a shot

I roll up my shirt sleeve
They look at me not understand’n

‘ No you need to bend over
‘ In Mexico we shoot by butt
