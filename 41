XXXXI
Hitch'n 
Backcountry roads
 
Thumb like a sifter
Filter'n the masses

Patient for those
Kindred to me

The foundation 
Of this connection  
Laid in their past

Upon me
They reflect & remember
The open road & free flow

They bestow upon me counsel
Of wisdom learned
In their day

A lineage of adventurers
___

Upon the Newfoundland 
Windswept barrens

Exhausted from the long haul
Erroded like the coast

Each pass'n car
Beats me by bits

Like the waves
Against the rocky bay

A large block of cheese
& Half bagel in my hand

Dried meat
& Half bagel
In my mouth

Stand'n up
Thumb out

I seen your car rise
On the dreary horizon

Hope is all one really needs
After long hiatus & failure

One ride can propel you 
Forward to the finish

A laborer
In the oil fields
Of Alberta

Have'n hitched in your day
Bored this day recover'n
From carpul tunnel surgery

Your wife take'n care
Of the elderly man

Now parapalegic
From collide’n with a moose

On his way home 
From babysitting your boy
_

I appreciate the ride 
To Crab River

But I treasure
The powwow we shared

Map out
& You assure'n me
By logistics
I could make
Gros Morne that day

By bus
On boat

Walk'n long
Hitch'n far

Up to the bogs of Gros Morne
End'n the day hammock up
_

We exchanged names
Multiple times

Know'n we would 
Never remember

But each time hope’n
This over others different
.
