 LXVIII
Path blazed
By omnipotent forces

Not that of water
Which chooses paths of least resistance

Not that of animal
Which chooses paths in seclusion

Nor that of man
Which chooses paths to interests

_

Two Universities
Two Deans

Sure as proof 
Of a principal

The result my eviction 
From their institutions

Academia & its cohorts
Interested not in intelligence
 _

Myself my master
Ear to the Earth
Steps sync'd to
Rotations & Revolutions

My path that of gods
Which chooses paths to ideas

Unix Perl Algebra

The eminent ideas of gods
Truly the paths themselves

The blessings of gods
 That of omnipresent forces

Tho this a journey
One has already arrived
+
+
+
Transcendence

When one breaches
Past borders

Of the bounds
Born into

Testaments to where
Humanity can go

A waypoint
A ghost of the future

To be finally comprehended
By the masses

Only after humanity
Has evolved

Then they looking back
To the past

Reassured of the
Omniscient hand of Fate

Grateful
Of the sacrifice of
Supernatural beings
Sustained by Ethereal Bounties
Which their contemporaries
Blindly proclaimed imaginary
+
+
+
Tho I feel the pain
Of your disdain

Forgiveness a reflex
When your bearing exposed
.
