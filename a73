I only spent $20
On a hostel twice

This hostel the one worth it

The owner an Alumni
Thanks for the Aquamira

Offer’d after learn’n
I ran out of treatment

Lost
Track’n skills nullified

From ridges 
In a new freeze

Fluffy with the health 
Of a first winter storm

Jaws of hell
Fire Cold Infinities
Alone with no savior

Slowly the virus
Became diarrhea

A serious symptom
That kept me crawl’n 
At times

Those few encounters
With FreightTrain
Kept my goal in mind

I don’t think 
I would have finished
All alone

Cross barefoot
With only shorts

Dry with bandanna
Redry with clothes

Both inexperienced

Lit up with FrieghtTrain
