Mexicans use concrete structures as houses
Which keep heat like ovens

Beneath
The North Mexican desert sun

Up on the foothills
A cool breeze was to be had

By sleep’n on the roof
In this poor mountain village

Not one night had passed
My missionary companion & I woke
To see football-sized concrete boulders
Shatter’n inches from our heads

The un-entertained poor
Showered down meteorites from the mountains

Crash’n in heaps
All around us
_

Ain't nothing new
From remains

Left by un-entertained poor
I’d seen so far

Dogs been bound by wire
& Burnt alive

Dogs dangling from the nooses
Lashed on trees

Puppies poisoned
Into excruciating deaths

For sport from want of recreation
_

This was my missionary companion’s
First & only area on his mission

He hurt himself
In attempts to be excused honorably home

I never understood why he left
.

I arrived in Hong Kong
With nowhere to go

I took 5 trains
To the islandic mountains

After meeting friends
We ate at a
Remote white-sanded beach

Rumor told of a waterfall
Just around the mountain side

Tho it was late
My companions headed out
As dusk came

A waterfall to leap from
Is worth whatever risk

Under the hot Hong Kong sun
I climbed

Up & over the mountainside

To the back reaches
To the waterfall

To arrive alone
At the last rays of day
&
 Take the leap
Into untested dark waters
.

Once as I hitch'd to Canada
The guy give'n me the lift
Offered me a job with his brother Jeff

I built houses with that
Sect of Polygamists
All summer long in Montana

I will never forget

‘ Jeff you know we are related
‘ In about 4 different ways
.
