In the morn
I went to search for gear
To supplement my current set from 
Urban Backpack'n

A 13mi trek to
Sports Authority
By word of mouth

To make mistakes
Cheaply

At Pidemont Park
I eazily dozed off

A successful test of the 
Thermarest Z Pad

A middle-aged woman
Sat swing’n

Only despair 
 & 2 Overstuffed suitcases

I saw her in me
But I couldn’t see me in her

I had the momentum
Of one last 
All-In

Parks are my favorite places

A couple in their 50s
Both teachers in Cummings
Invited me to stay with them

Wayne offered to pick me up
After a Couchsurfing event

We left in a rush because
He had business
To take care of

I told him
‘ That’s fine
‘ Good thing I brought
‘ My Ereader

In that awkward way
Of tell’n your host
Not to feel burdened

 Wayne only continued
‘ Have you ever seen someone
‘ That owes you money

Wayne asked more to himself
His pitch began to rise
In excitement

‘ You should have seen her face
‘ When she recognized me

Wayne cranked the music
Awake in his own world
We raced towards Downtown

On my long trek
To Sports Authority

I had passed the run-down
Strip club

We now pulled into

I had wondered what went on
In such a shit hole

Odd how life
Answers questions

' Hold this
Wayne handed me a pamphlet
Of some schmuck
Running for Sheriff

‘ Make sure she sees it
‘ She will get the picture
