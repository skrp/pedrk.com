John

With form of Man
Squared exponentially

Long hair
Cut chin
Tower’n 6.5ft
Large hands
Big Feet
Muscular Physique

In a Democratic Age
Where the weak reign

These miracles of manliness
Are greatly depreciated

A wayside spectacle
Lost in this cult

‘ You can stay for a day
‘ Or stay

One of them offered
After show’n me the grounds

‘ My daughter is 18

The father offered
If I would stay

From early morn till night
A Community United

Gets that weird
Family oddness
