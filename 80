 LXXX
Hour
& A half long classes

Were real muthrfkrs
Never could be still
Very long

Stevo
Commonly known as
Crackhead Stevo

A bad choice
To go to in need

Tomorrow Friday
4 Term tests

He must have been
The only friend at hand

Cause he promised me
Tomorrow he would get me
Some herbal pills
To help me focus

 All I needed
Was the Red Bull

Jason came with
For the save

After the trip
To the convenience store
+

8:50am 
Our Spot

Uncontested under the tree
In the parking lot

Facing away
From school

I downed the 2 pills
With the Red Bull

' I couldn't find
' Those herbal pills
He admitted

' What did you give me?
 I didn't know
If I should be alarmed

' I don't know
He replied calmly

Anthony came in
For the save

' Here take these
' Two adderral
' They will definitely 
' Make you focus

Mid test
I twerk the fk out

Never been high before
Hit me like a truck

Mrs. Hawkins
Mr. Caranco

Knew I was blitzed
Out of my mind

They all dealt with me
In a fashion
Kind & Understanding

One lady
Compassionate

Crux of the illness
Nothing around
In the middle of maine

Small shop owner
Gave me tea
 & Sent me to a lady

Tho I in terrible sickness
She was compassionate

If I ever had karma banked
Gladly cash it all in
To have met her

I don't remember her name
But I remember
Her favorite book I read
.

Buenos Aires
In quaint riot

Their government
Worked to renew a war

The Falklands War 

A tragic moment of regret
Embodied in their
Center city memorial

The one place where
I had never felt so safe

Police on every corner
8:30am Brigtht day

24 hours later
A Frenchman was stabbed
At that memorial
For his work camera
By a immigrant

Them forced as refugees
To the trash after 2am
I would see them
In their daily sift
On back alley ways

Or as whores
Mattress at hand
In a tucked away park

Tho I'd like to mention
El Botanico

A cat refuge
Made out of a
Deep wooded
Deep city park

A place
Only in fantasy
_

Tires Burn'n
On ancient cobblestone streets

Of a worn sea port
Resilient against the scum
That come with the tide

In true Democratic spirit
The Govt ditched the idea

The people let themselves
Be heard

& The Govt
In fidelity listened 
 +

That summer later
Under the
Virginia sun at its prime

A British ex-special forces
Put me up for two nights

My first zero

I got him drunk
& Pushed him for tales

He told me
About a time
When he served in
The Falklands War

' They sent boys
' With little better
' Than pocket knives
' We had no choice
' But to shoot them

In the time of conflict
What will happen here

The Father of Democracy
A land envisioned by Forefathers

Will the Govt
Listen to its people
.

This what  I wrote
Tonight as I turn
To my poetry

After my MINION daemons
All failed to persist

Insta Crash
To chasing tails endlessly
& Everything in between

As if the code itself
Convexed back in
On itself

Trolls
Must have taken
Electronic Forms

Or am only I
To blame for my failures
.
