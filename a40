Ship'n to Buena Vista

It wouldn't arrive
Till the next day

An oddly Mormon town
It crumbled in decay

At the tables of its public pavilion
The cops came by

Despite the thunderstorm
They kick'd me out

Forced to hitch past midnight

A kid in a Jeep
Gave me a ride
To the mountain pass
_

It was late 
The moon wasn't out

Near the ridge I decided upon a rest
It be'n around 3:30am

I heard the presence
Of a large animal behind me

I picked up a rock
Threw it in that direction

After a few moments
A rock came fly'n back

Freaked to hell
I got my stuff
& Hiked as fast as I could

A few miles later
At a shelter 
.5mi off the trail

The log was sparse
FrieghtTrain stop’d here during lunch
But left because it was 
‘ too creepy

It was a common adjective 
Used in the log

The quaint shelter
In a clear'n 
Of dark woods
With small creek
Flow'n thru

That is kinda creepy
I reasoned
_

Days later 
I discovered
 
That was the shelter
That FBI signs warned of

Posted the past 
50mi on the trail

Last year a lone hiker
Spent time in town

Found dead behind that shelter
Killed with a knife 
Buried in a shallow grave

I never read adversements
