The trucker dumped me on the highway
I was thankful

Tho I had to rummage thru 
Thickets to enter the city

Naturally head’n Downtown

Around Dusk
Around a Drum Circle

A street girl
Tried to warm up
& Gank my pen

Her friends
A Blonde & Redhead
Nearly sisters
Talked with me

The blonde’s summer dress
 Revealed Black Flags
Tattooed on her thigh

A Copperhead bit her 
Last July

She introduced me to Occupy

With Occupy
Dure’n that torrential rain

Flood’n past inches into feet
V

V
The Occupy
Presence in Harrisburg
Only a group of homeless ex-cons

Supported by an unknown entity
Protest’n Downtown by remote directives

Downtown 
At a military surplus

As an Eagle Scout 
It is a surprise
To bled 
When test’n a blade

Outside I decided to return 
To purchase what kiss'd me

Tho there was no money to spare
Her lipstick served too strong a memory

The Spax SP-18
Cost a dear $50

Kayak Micheal

After run’n around 
The streets with Occupy

I headed to a coffee shop
Hustle’n smartly

I still had no idea
Where to take Christina
When she arrived at 1:30am

A man want’n to boast
Invited me to coffee

He told his tales 
Cycle’n & Kyak’n

For all to hear
A habit of mine as well

His woman came by
A Redhead

Tina told me a girl
Nearly her daughter
‘ got bit by a copperhead

‘ Last July
I finish

Christina would have 
A couch that night

Micheal lived the 
Adventurer’s Code

Drive’n us to the trailhead
Micheal is a friend
Found by fate
