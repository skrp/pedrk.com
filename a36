B-Rad had been 
A good host to me

Even if he was a bit scum
In the way of those 
Who only seek self-interest

Zach & I
Had plans to adventure
But I first had to repay 
Kindness recieved

B-Rad had too many dishes
Dirty for too many weeks

I helped clean them
Appreciate'n the bewilderment
Of one unaccustomed to gratitude

B-Rads step-father 
Plan’d to come by

His life
Due for a check up

B-Rad himself almost old
Tho childish in his pleas for support
 
With a child’s keenness 
That freed him from the various 
Preplaced Logical Traps
_

One such had been 
A confirmed Ace

In conspire’n with the neighbor
The patron accused him of
Smoke’n weed on the porch
Have’n been seen that morn

‘ Did you see me smoke?
B-Rad asked me

Under such circumstance 
I had no choice
Unable to call me a liar
The patron was groundless

In such cleverness
Did he weasel out
Of any requirement for rebuke

B-Rad hustled me a ride
The 30min drive 
Back to the trail
I couldn't say no

I asked if we could stop 
& Get Zach

But the patron 
Advised me against such companionship

‘ In all likelihood
‘ Someone like that

Forgot about any friendship
In the booze of a new day
