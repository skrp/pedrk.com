My chi
A centered fluid

Honed by years of
Prayer TaiChi & Yoga

Meditation
Not of my sphere

My intake is the environment
My process forged by encounters

Circumstance & I

A process of react’n
& Then reform’n

Like the cataclysm
Of chemical properties
_

As a new spring
Blazes down

Post-winter mountainsides

Joyful
Down finite scapes

Each day
With new twists
_

Know’n my seasons vibrancy
Mere moments

Till I am taken back again
Into that which formed me

My aftermath not relevant
To the present

Pure from reward
I nurture my stable Center
.
.
.
Wild Plant Magic

I have experienced
More mysticism than most

Such rooted history
Should not be sneered

All matter
Retains energy
_

Up the Uinta Ridge
Pluck’n under the boon of Elune

After a kindly drizzle
 Peruse'n the mountainsides

Fair beauty
Sweet smell’n
Distinct in character

Favorite’n
The lucky ones

Lone herbs undisturbed
In midst of rockslides

The pristine leaf
Among decayed brethren

Over time barren ridges
Inside folded ravines

Of these I worked
Into satchets
.
.
.
Child philosopher
Constantly churn’n thoughts

Alone on late walks
Free from constraint

Foster’n to seek
That which is most precious

Conclude’n wealth & position
Ever fluid & once lost
One is left worse off

Memories fade
But write'n circumvents entropy

Conjoined the two
Able to warm future days
_

Tales I once thought
Never to be forgot

Blown away traceless
Like sand of a wayside beach
.
