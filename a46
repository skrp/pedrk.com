An experienced backpacker

Feels the weight 
Of a pair of Poptarts

An experienced backpacker
Daily adjusts pack straps
In order to keep the weight 
In ideal positions

An experienced backpacker
Has a routine method to pack
90% Strip’d every night
Reassembled every morn

An experienced backpacker
Is aware
Weight Size & Quantity
All come into play

Sky Meadows State Park
On a bright
But partially dreary day

Moisture call’n 
All to life

Energize'd cellularly 
With sleek appeal

Just the right 
Amount of meadow
To still feel like forest

Just the right
Amount of open-expanses
To allow appreciation 
Of panoramic views

Mile 20
Refresh’d as morn

Today I swore I'd reach 1000mi
