In the morn I ate breakfast
At the Quality Inn 
With the Bathsalt Gang

Raid'n Inns for breakfast
Was an easy trick

If you woke early 
To get first dibs
_

At a Laundry Mat
Butt-naked under my poncho

A homeless came up to converse

‘ Man I had the worse night
‘ I slept in a porta-potty
‘ Some guy around 6am 
‘ Burst in & tripped over me
‘ Try'n to take a shit

I gave him the rest of the breakfast
From Quality Inn

Then I returned there
For Last Call

Shenandoahs
Roll’n easily

Clouds descended 
To proximity

Peace of Tranquility 
Saturates the grounds

Black snakes & bunnies
Tourists & food
Dry scapes & gush'n spouts

Hombre gave me my first 
Mountain House

An expensive dehydrated meal
I had to eat it off the ground 
I am clumsy

Freight Train & I powwow
As his birthday gift

I ended up chase'n a rabbit
Thru hidden pathways
Thru the bramble
